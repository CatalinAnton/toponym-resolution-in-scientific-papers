In februari 2006 , kaduna state in nigeria wa the first of 36 state to report infect of poultri with highli pathogen avian influenza viru ( h5n1 ) . current , infect ha spread to 22 of the 36 nigerian state and to the feder capit territori . In februari 2007 , 1 case of avian influenza wa report in a woman from the southern state of lago . thu , the exten- sive circul of influenza viru ( h5n1 ) in nigeria rais concern about human and anim health issu . A previ- ou studi indic that 2 sublineag ( ema1 and ema2 ) were cocircul in nigeria in 2006 ( 1 ) ; howev , 3 sub- lineag were identifi in a more recent studi ( 2 ) , name sublineag A ( correspond to ema2 ) and sublineag B and C ( correspond to ema1 ) . the 2007 studi by salz- berg et al . also identifi a viru show a 4:4 reassort- ment between gene of sublineag ema1 and ema2 ( 1 ) . the aim of our studi is to provid addit inform on the genet characterist of isol that were circulat- ing in nigeria in earli 2007 . the studi twelv repres influenza viru ( h5n1 ) sampl from differ nigerian outbreak were select ( tabl 1 ) by take into account the geograph origin and the date of isol . We then character these virus by sequenc- ing the entir genom . sampl were process for viru isol , subtyp- ing , and pathotyp ( 3,4 ) . the amplif of the 8 viral gene segment wa carri out with revers transcript ( RT ) â­pcr by use gene-specif primer ( avail upon request ) . pcr product were sequenc in a 3100 avant genet analyz ( appli biosystem , foster citi , CA , usa ) . phylogenet analysi wa perform by use the neighbor-join method as implement in the mega 3 program , clustalw softwar ( www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/ clustalw2/index.html ) ( 5 ) . genbank access no . for the 8-gene segment of the 12 nigerian strain are eu148356 to eu148451 . As expect , all nigerian isol were close relat to the virus that have been circul in bird through- out europ , russia , africa , and the middl east sinc late 2005 . accord to the unifi nomenclatur system for highli pathogen influenza viru ( h5n1 ) , these isol belong to clade 2.2 ( 6 ) . phylogenet analysi of all 8 gene segment of the recent nigerian strain show that 10 of these strain , la- bele ema1/ema2-2:6 reassort 2007 ( ema1/ema2- 2:6-r07 ) ( tabl 1 ) , have the same genotyp . In particular , the genet comparison of the hemagglutinin ( HA ) and non- structur ( NS ) gene of ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 show that they are deriv from virus of the ema1 sublineag ( 2 ) and have the highest similar with the first nigerian strain isol , a/chicken/nigeria/641/2006 ( homolog rang between 99.3 % and 99.7 % ) . We observ differ topol- ogi for the remain gene segment ( neuraminidas , nu- cleoprotein [ NP ] , matrix , heterotrimer polymeras com- plex [ PA , pb1 , and pb2 ] ) . phylogenet analysi show that the nucleotid sequenc of these gene fall into ema2 sublineag ; the highest homolog wa observ with re- spectiv gene segment of the nigerian strain isol in 2006 , which belong to ema2 ( homolog rang between 99.4 % and 99.7 % ) . the separ of the gene segment into 2 cluster ( figur 1 , 2 ) is evid of reassort ( 7 ) . the genet pattern of ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 viru is distinct from that of a/chicken/nigeria/1047-62/2006 vi- ru isol in june , 2006 in taraba state and recogn previous as an ema1/ema2-4:4 reassort viru ( 2 ) ( tabl 2 ) . the remain 2 virus were not reassort . they were detect in sokoto state and belong to sublin- eag ema2 . sequenc analysi show that the receptor bind site of all of the nigerian virus under studi retain amino acid residu ( gln 222 and gli 224 ) . these residu pref- erenti recogn receptor with saccharid termin in sialic acid-2-3-galactos ( sa2-3gal ) , specif for avi- an speci ( 8 ) . mutat that are relat to neuraminidas emerg infecti diseas Â· www.cdc.gov/eid Â· vol . 14 , No . 4 , april 2008 637 *vial dell'universitã , legnaro , padova , itali ; nation veterinari research institut , plateau state , vom , nigeria ; and univers of ibadan , oya state , ibadan , nigeria 1 these author contribut equal to thi articl . inhibitor and adamantan resist were not detect in ani of the 12 isol ( 9 ) . all 12 nigerian virus possess the pb2 627k mutat associ with increas virul of influenza viru ( h5n1 ) in mice ( 10 ) . two other host spe- cific mutat were observ for NP and PA gene . In par- ticular , the NP gene contain a human specif amino acid signatur at posit 33 ( v33i ) ( 11 ) in all select isol . A human specif amino acid signatur wa also detect at posit 100 ( v100a ) of the PA gene of a/chicken/ nigeria/1071-3/2007 and a/chicken/nigeria/1071-7/2007 strain ( 12 ) . conclus the result of our studi show that 10 of 12 strain ob- tain over a 39-day period were ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 reassort virus , and that these were circul in at least 7 nigerian state . thi appear to be the onli report of a reassort viru gener by h5n1 virus belong- ing to the 2.2 clade spread extens in poultri . thu , the virus circul in 2007 in nigeria differ from the origin sublineag prototyp introduc dure 2006 . our find also suggest that an influenza viru ( h5n1 ) with dispatch 638 emerg infecti diseas Â· www.cdc.gov/eid Â· vol . 14 , No . 4 , april 2008 tabl 1 . list of influenza viru ( h5n1 ) sampl analyz in poultri , nigeria , 2007 viru group state of isol date of isol a/chicken/nigeria/1071-1/2007 ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 plateau jan 2 a/chicken/nigeria/1071-3/2007 ema2 sokoto jan 5 a/chicken/nigeria/1071-4/2007 ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 borno jan 5 a/chicken/nigeria/1071-5/2007 ema1/ema2-2:6â­r07 plateau jan 6 a/chicken/nigeria/1071-7/2007 ema2 sokoto jan 10 a/chicken/nigeria/1071-9/2007 ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 bauchi jan 12 a/chicken/nigeria/1071-10/2007 ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 anambra jan 13 a/chicken/nigeria/1071-15/2007 ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 kaduna jan 23 a/chicken/nigeria/1071-22/2007 ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 kano jan 31 a/duck/nigeria/1071-23/2007 ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 borno feb 1 a/chicken/nigeria/1071-29/2007 ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 lago feb 9 a/chicken/nigeria/1071-30/2007 ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 kaduna feb 10 figur 1 . phylogenet tree for the hemagglutinin gene of influenza virus construct by neighbor-join method . sequenc obtain in thi studi were label with a circl ( ema1/ema2-2:6- r07 group ) and triangl ( ema2 group ) . the remain sequenc can be found in genbank . the number at each branch point repres bootstrap valu , and they were determin by bootstrap analysi by use 1,000 replic . scale bar = 0.01 nucleotid substitutions/sit . figur 2 . phylogenet tree for nucleoprotein gene of influenza virus construct by neighbor-join method . sequenc obtain in thi studi were label with a circl ( ema1/ema2-2:6- r07 group ) and triangl ( ema2 group ) . the remain sequenc can be found in genbank . the number at each branch point repres bootstrap valu , and they were determin by bootstrap analysi by use 1,000 replic . scale bar = 0.01 nucleotid substitutions/sit . reassort influenza ( h5n1 ) in poultri , nigeria new genet characterist ha emerg in < 7 month and is widespread in nigeria . the emerg of at least 2 reassort virus in nigeria show that co-infect with virus of differ sublineag ha occur presum in poultri . thi evi- denc is most like a result of poor biosecur measur implement by the poultri industri , particularli the live- bird market system , which is known to facilit mingl of infect bird . In nonindustri countri , live bird market system sometim allow bird of differ spe- cie and of unknown health statu to share limit space , often the same cage . bird in the incub stage or breed that show a reduc clinic suscept may not appear overtli ill and therefor , may be trade in live bird market system . the movement of infect bird across neighbor region could explain the genet related found between influenza viru ( h5n1 ) isol obtain from 7 nigerian state . the predomin of a reas- sortant viru in nigeria mimick the previous report predomin of the Z genotyp viru in asia , although thi genotyp is believ to contain intern gene origi- nate from noninfluenza virus ( 13 ) . the introduct of influenza viru ( h5n1 ) of differ cluster in 2005 in vietnam , also result in the emerg of a reassort strain . unlik the nigerian situat describ here , the vietnames reassort influenza viru ( h5n1 ) did not becom predomin in vietnam ( 2 ) . current , the genet characterist of the human ni- gerian isol are unavail . given that human infect occur after direct contact with infect poultri , studi need to be perform to establish whether the predomin avian influenza viru ( ema1/ema2-2:6-r07 ) ha also been respons for human infect . amino acid muta- tion toward increas bind to human receptor , name- ly n182k , q192r , q226l , and g228 substitut in the HA gene ( 14,15 ) , do not seem to have occur in nigerian influenza ( h5n1 ) strain to date . howev , 2 molecular chang , the 33 NP valin to isoleucin substitut , which is typic of human influenza virus ( 11 ) , and the 627 pb2 glutam acid to lysin mutat , which increas virul in the mammalian host , have been detect in all analyz strain ( 10 ) . the result of our studi suggest that depopul and biosecur measur adopt in nigeria are not suffici to prevent the spread of the viru and should be improv . poultri farmer and smallhold poultri produc ( those produc a limit number of poultri ) must be educ on appropri control measur for avian influenza . In ad- dition , isol and genet character of african in- fluenza viru ( h5n1 ) isol in a transpar environ , should be promot and support so that more inform can be gather on the evolut of thi viru in africa . acknowledg We thank fao/anim health servic of the anim pro- duction and health divis of fao for support sequenc analysi of strain and facilit sampl submiss and katha- rine sturm-ramirez for her assist . thi studi wa possibl through contact establish in the framework of the technic cooper project fund by the food and agricultur organ of the unit nation ( fao ) . the work wa also fund and support by the EU project : gener of inform and tool to support the manag of the avian influenza crisi in poultri ( fluaid ) and train and technolog transfer of avian influenza diagnost and diseas manag skill ( flutrain ) .
