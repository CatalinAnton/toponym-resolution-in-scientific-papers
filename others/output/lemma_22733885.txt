я ╗ ┐full genom sequenc of a recombin h5n1 influenza viru from a condor in southern china peirong jiao , runyu yuan , yafen song , liangmeng wei , tao ren , ming liao , and kaijian luo moa key laboratori for anim vaccin develop , key laboratori of zoonos control and prevent of guangdong , colleg of veterinari medicin , south china agricultur univers , guangzhou , china In thi studi , we report the first genom inform on an h5n1 avian influenza viru ( aiv ) isol from a condor in guang- dong provinc in southern china in 2003 . full genom sequenc and phylogenet analys show that it is a recombin viru contain genom segment deriv from the eurasia and north america gene pool . thi will be use for analys of the evo- lution of h5n1 aiv in southern china . h5n1 highli pathogen avian influenza ( hpai ) is caus by h5n1 influenza A viru , which can result in seriou system or respiratori diseas in bird . h5n1 avian influenza virus ( aiv ) have been report to be transmit from wild bird to domest poultri and variou mammalian speci ( 1 ) . In 1996 , the h5n1 hpai viru ( a/goose/guangdong/1/1996 ) wa first iso- late from a sick goos in southern china ( 2 , 9 ) . In 1997 , the transmiss of h5n1 virus to human had caus the death of 6 of 18 infect person in southern china ( 3 , 8 ) . sinc 2003 , h5n1 hpai virus which had develop a high degre antigen variat began to spread and caus seriou outbreak in more than 60 countri of asia , europ , and africa , not onli result in the destruct of hundr of million of poultri but also caus seriou infect and death of human . therefor , h5n1 aiv are zoonot agent recogn as a continu threat to both the poultri industri and human public health . here , a h5n1 influenza viru ( a/condor/guangdong/139/ 2003 [ gd139 ] ) wa isol from a sick condor in southern china in 2003 . To investig more inform about thi recombin viru , we determin the complet genom se- quenc with an abi 3730 genet analyz use the sanger method , which is base on dna fragment amplifi by pcr with a previou primer ( 5 ) . sequenc fragment were assem- bled use sequench 5.0 . the 8 genom segment of the viru encod 10 protein ( pb2 , pb1 , PA , HA , NP , NA , M1 , M2 , ns1 , and ns2 ) with length of 759 , 757 , 716 , 568 , 498 , 449 , 252 , 97 , 225 , and 121 amino acid , respect . there are 20- and 5-amino-acid delet in NA and ns1 , respect . the gd139 viru ha a seri of basic amino acid at the cleavag site of the HA ( rrkkr ) that is characterist of hpai virus . the receptor-bind pocket of ha1 retain the amino acid residu q226 and g228 ( H3 number ) , which preferenti bind to the avian influenza viru receptor ( 4 ) . the pb2 protein ha E and D at posit 627 and 701 , which are characterist of the avian influ- enza viru ( 6 , 7 ) . phylogenet analysi of gd139 reveal that the HA and NA gene belong to the eurasia gene pool ( a/hong kong/213/2003 [ h5n1 ] -like viru ) and share 99 % and 94.7 % nucleotid ident with hk213-like viru , respect . the intern gene show that pb1 , PA , NP , M , and NS gene also belong to the eurasia gene pool and exhibit more than 99 % , 96 % , 99 % and 99 % sequenc ident to hk213-like viru , respect . howev , the pb2 gene belong to the north america gene pool and ha 94 % sequenc ident with the a/pheasant/nj/9804570/1998 ( h5n2 ) viru . thu , gd139 viru is a recombin viru between the eurasia gene pool and the north america gene pool which ha rare been report in southern china . the genom inform on thi h5n1 natur recombin viru from a condor will be help for analys of the evolut of h5n1 aiv in southern china . nucleotid sequenc access number . the genom se- quenc of a/condor/guangdong/139/2003 ( h5n1 ) have been deposit in genbank under access number jq966928 to jq966935 . acknowledg thi work wa support by grant from the agricultur scienc and technolog project of china ( no . 2011gb2e000005 ) , the natur scienc foundat of guangdong provinc ( no . 10251064201000004 and 10151064201000021 ) , the nation natur scienc foundat of china ( no . 31172343 ) , the scienc and technolog project of guang- dong provinc ( no . 2010b020307005 ) , the earmark fund for mod- ern agro-industri technolog research system ( nycytx-42-g3-03 ) , and the high-level talent in univers project of guangdong prov- inc . refer 1 . belser JA , szretter KJ , katz JM , tumpey TM . 2009 . use of anim model to understand the pandem potenti of highli pathogen avian influenza virus . adv . viru re . 73:55тн97 . 2 . chen H , Yu K , Bu Z . 1999 . molecular analysi of hemagglutinin gene of a goos origin highli pathogen avian influenza viru . chin . agric . sci . 32 : 87тн92 . 3 . claa EC , et al . 1998 . human influenza A h5n1 viru relat to a highli pathogen avian influenza viru . lancet 351:472тн477 . 4 .
