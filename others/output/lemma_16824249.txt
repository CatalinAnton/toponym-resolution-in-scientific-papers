Of import is the fact that recognit of human-lik receptor specif by recent h9n2 virus in asia could have facilit direct transmiss to human [ 8 ] . thu , h9n2 virus along with h5n1 virus are high on the list of candid that could potenti caus a futur human influenza pandem . howev , sinc it first detect in southern china ( i.e . a/goose/guandong/1/96 ) , the h5n1 influenza A viru ha spread in asian countri , where it is now enzoot and ha caus multipl outbreak in poultri [ 9 , 10 ] . among them , the isol of an h5n1 viru from duck meat import from china to korea in 2001 rais the possibl of the introduct of virus and transmiss to human from novel sourc [ 11 ] . given thi possibl , the japanes govern decid in 2001 to halt the import of duck meat and to survey for the presenc of the virus in import chicken product from china at the anim quarantin servic ( aq ) . dure thi process , h9n2 virus and newcastl diseas virus were isol from chicken product such as meat and bone marrow . In thi studi , we perform a genet , antigen , and pathogen analysi of h9n2 virus isol * author for correspond : Dr M. mase , depart of infecti diseas , nation institut of anim health , 3-1-5 kannondai , tsukuba , ibaraki 305-0856 , japan .

HI and NI test were perform accord to standard procedur [ 13 ] . genet and phylogenet analysi rna extract , rtâ­pcr , and sequenc of the pcr product were carri out as describ previous [ 12 ] . pcr amplif of the code region of the viral gene segment wa perform with gene-specif primer set ( sequenc of the primer avail upon request ) . the nucleotid sequenc were analys use version 12.0 of the sequenc analysi softwar packag genetyx-mac ( softwar develop , tokyo , japan ) . the nucleotid sequenc obtain from thi studi are avail from genbank under access number ab256663â­ab256750 . multipl align were conduct by the cluster X program [ 14 ] , and phylogenet tree were construct by the neighbour-join ( NJ ) method as previous describ [ 15 ] . base on each phylogenet analysi of each gene segment , the genotyp of the h9n2 virus isol from chicken product were compar with previous report genotyp [ 2 , 7 , 16â­18 ] . tabl 1 . h9n2 influenza A virus isol from chicken product import from china at aq viru abbrevi origin amino acid residue* genotyp correspond genotyp 183 190 226 a/chicken/osaka/aq48/97 ck/os/aq48/97 shanghai N A Q I A [ 18 ] a/chicken/osaka/aq19/2001 ck/os/aq19/01 shenzhen N V L II novel a/chicken/kobe/aq26/2001 ck/ko/aq26/01 shandong N T L iii dk/st/1605/01 [ 2 ] a/chicken/yokohama/aq55/2001 ck/yo/aq55/01 jilin N V L II novel a/chicken/osaka/aq58/2001 ck/os/aq58/01 liaon N A L IV dk/st/1796/00 [ 2 ] a/chicken/osaka/aq69/2001 ck/os/aq69/01 shanghai N A L V H [ 18 ] a/chicken/yokohama/aq120/2001 ck/yo/aq120/01 jilin N A L VI F [ 18 ] a/chicken/yokohama/aq135/2001 ck/yo/aq135/01 shenzhen N T L II novel a/chicken/yokohama/aq144/2001 ck/yo/aq144/01 jilin N V L VI F a/chicken/yokohama/aq45/2002 ck/yo/aq45/02 shandong N V L I A a/chicken/yokohama/aq134/2002 ck/yo/aq134/02 shandong N A L iii dk/st/1605/01 [ 2 ] * H3 number . h9n2 isol from chicken product 387 pathogen to chicken three isol , ck/os/aq19/01 , ck/ko/aq26/01 , and ck/yo/aq55/01 , were chosen for the pathogen test . for pathogen test accord to the guidelin establish by the world organ for anim health ( offic intern de epizooti ; oie ) [ 19 ] , 6-week-old spf chicken were use in thi studi . eight chicken were inocul intraven with 0.2 ml of a 1:10 dilut of infect allanto fluid , and clinic sign were observ daili for 10 day . In addit , we perform an intracerebr inocul test accord to that for the newcastl diseas viru base on the guidelin establish by the oie [ 19 ] . ten chicken were inocul intracerebr with 0.05 ml of a 1:10 dilut of in- fect allanto fluid and clinic sign were observ daili for 8 day . result genet and phylogenet analysi the HA gene of the h9n2 virus isol from chicken product belong to the a/chicken/beijing/ 1/94 ( ck/bj/1/94 ) sub-lineag [ fig . ( a ) ; phylogenet tree of gene of influenza A virus can be seen in the figur on the journal 's websit ] as describ by Li et al . [ 18 ] . the amino-acid sequenc at the HA cleav- age site of h9n2 isol from chicken product possess a parssr-glf motif , which corre- spond to low-pathogen virus [ 1 , 16 , 20 ] . the amino acid at the receptor bind site of HA protein are associ with differ in the receptor bind specif [ 21 ] . tabl 1 show the amino-acid posit 183 , 190 , and 226 ( number accord to H3 HA ) . all h9n2 virus isol from chicken product possess N at amino-acid posit 183 . except for one strain ( ck/os/aq48/97 ) , all h9n2 virus isol from chicken product possess L at amino-acid posit 226 . five potenti glycosyl site in ha1 ( 11 , 123 , 200 , 280 , and 287 ) were con- serv in all h9n2 virus isol from chicken product ( data not shown ) . the M gene of the h9n2 virus isol from chicken product also belong to the ck/bj/1/94 sub-lineag [ fig . ( b ) ] [ 18 ] . resist to the two type of influenza antivir compound ( M2 ion channel blocker , e.g . amantadin and rimantadin , and NA inhibitor , e.g . oseltamivir and zanamivir [ 22 ] ) is as- sociat with particular mutat . virus becom resist to amantadin through a singl amino-acid substitut at posit 26 , 27 , 30 , 31 , or 34 in the transmembran region of the M2 protein [ 23 ] . two isol , ck/os/19/01 and ck/yo/45/02 , have the amino-acid substitut at posit 30 ( A to T ) and 31 ( S to N ) , and these substitut confer resist to amantadin in the M2 protein , respect . the NA gene of the h9n2 virus isol from the chicken product also divid into two sub-lineag ( ck/bj/1/94-like and ck/hk/g9/97-like ) [ 18 ] [ fig . ( c ) ] . six isol cluster with ck/bj/1/94-like virus , which contain a three ( at amino-acid pos- ition 63â­65 ) amino-acid delet in the stalk region . the other five isol cluster with ck/hk/g9/97- like virus , which do not contain a stalk delet . through a singl amino-acid substitut at posit 119 , 152 , 274 , 292 or 294 in the NA activ centr [ 24 , 25 ] , virus can becom resist to oseltamivir . none of the amino-acid substitut that were resist to oseltamivir in the NA protein were found in the h9n2 virus isol from chicken product . phylogenet analysi of the remain gene seg- ment of the h9n2 isol from chicken product suggest that they were divid into six genotyp ( temporarili design iâ­vi ) [ fig . ( dâ­h ) , tabl 1 ] . these sequenc were compar with representa- tive h9n2 virus , includ ck/bj/1/94 , a/quail/ hong kong/g1/97 ( qa/hk/g1/97 ) , a/chicken/hong kong/g9/97 ( ck/hk/g9/97 ) , a/duck/hong kong/ y280/97 ( dk/hk/y280/97 ) , a/chicken/shanghai/ f/98 ( ck/sh/f/98 ) , and some duck virus isol in shantou , guangdong provinc in mainland china , report previous by other [ 2 , 7 , 16â­18 ] . compar with the h9n2 genotyp that have been describ ( tabl 1 ) , genotyp I seem to correspond to geno- type A defin by Li et al . [ 18 ] . genotyp iii and VI seem to correspond to genotyp dk/st/1605/01 and dk/st/1796/00 defin by Li et al . [ 2 ] respect- ive . genotyp V seem to correspond to genotyp H defin by Li et al . [ 18 ] . genotyp VI seem to correspond to genotyp F defin by Li et al . [ 18 ] . the remain genotyp II seem to be a novel genotyp in which the pb1 belong to the ck/bj/1/94 lineag , with the other seven segment correspond to genotyp I as defin by Li et al . [ 18 ] . antigen analysi antisera against the h9n2 isol from chicken product import from china react with all test strain within the threefold dilut of the 388 M. mase and other homolog HI titr ( tabl 2 ) . the reactiv of the h9n2 isol from chicken product to antisera against the H9 prototyp ty/wi/66 wa divers . howev , antisera against pa/chiba/1/97 , which be- long to the qa/hk/g1/97 lineag [ 12 ] , react with most test strain except ck/yo/aq55/01 , with the fourfold dilut lower than the homolog HI titr . NI test reveal that the antisera against the h9n2 isol from the chicken product import from china also react with most test strain within the threefold dilut of the homolog NI titr ( tabl 3 ) . differ from the result of the HI test , the antisera against pa/chiba/1/97 react with all test strain within the threefold dilut of the homolog NI titr . the antisera against the H9 prototyp ty/wi/66 react with most h9n2 isol from chicken product , with the fourfold dilut be lower than the homolog NI titr . pathogen test the three h9n2 isol from chicken product were not judg as highli pathogen for chicken by the oie guidelin , sinc none of the chicken die and tabl 2 . cross haemaggulutin inhibit test among h9n2 virus virus HI titr of chicken ' antisera ty/wi/66 ck/os/ aq48/97 pa/chiba/ 1/97 ck/yo/ aq55/01 ty/wi/66 1280 320 160 640 ck/os/aq48/97 1280 5120 80 1280 pa/chiba/1/97 320 640 2560 1280 pa/narita/92a/98 160 640 160 640 ck/os/aq19/01 160 1280 160 2560 ck/ko/aq26/01 160 2560 160 2560 ck/yo/aq55/01 320 2560 320 2560 ck/os/aq58/01 160 5120 160 1280 ck/os/aq69/01 80 2560 80 2560 ck/yo/aq120/01 80 2560 80 2560 ck/yo/aq135/01 40 1280 80 1280 ck/yo/aq144/01 40 1280 40 640 ck/yo/aq45/02 160 10240 160 5120 ck/yo/aq134/02 80 5120 80 2560 tabl 3 . cross neuraminidas activ inhibit test among h9n2 virus virus NI titr of chicken ' antisera ty/wi/66 ck/os/ aq48/97 pa/chiba/ 1/97 ck/yo/ aq55/01 ty/wi/66 2560 80 160 160 ck/os/aq48/97 80 320 80 80 pa/chiba/1/97 640 320 320 80 pa/narita/92a/98 320 80 640 40 ck/os/aq19/01 80 80 40 80 ck/ko/aq26/01 160 160 160 80 ck/yo/aq55/01 160 80 160 320 ck/os/aq58/01 80 320 160 320 ck/os/aq69/01 80 160 80 80 ck/yo/aq120/01 40 40 40 40 ck/yo/aq135/01 160 160 80 320 ck/yo/aq144/01 80 80 80 320 ck/yo/aq45/02 160 320 160 160 ck/yo/aq134/02 160 160 80 40 h9n2 isol from chicken product 389 no clinic sign were observ in the inocul chicken . In the intracerebr inocul test , onli one chicken inocul with ck/ko/aq26/01 die dure the observ period . the rang of valu of the intracerebr pathogen index of the test virus wa 0.00â­0.2 , which show low pathogen to chicken . discuss We character the h9n2 isol from chicken product import from china . the HA of these h9n2 virus seem to be antigen divers , but the NA seem to have a close relationship with one anoth . the amino acid of the receptor bind site in HA are similar to those affect human . almost all virus possess L at posit 226 , which is ident to the human H2 and H3 strain [ 8 ] . L at posit 226 bind to the neu aca2,6 gal linkag , wherea that possess Q 226 bind to the neu aca2,3 gal linkag [ 26 ] . these result suggest that the recent h9n2 virus might be candid for a pandem influenza outbreak in human . thi surveil of chicken product import from china wa conduct from 2001 to 2002 , and the h9n2 virus were isol from 17 ( 2.7 % ) of 621 sampl at a compar high frequenc . thi suggest that such contamin chicken product could be a potenti sourc for the introduct of avian influenza virus into other countri . the pathogen index indic that the h9n2 virus isol from chicken product were of low patho- genic to chicken , and the reason for the frequent isol of low-pathogen h9n2 virus from chicken product in thi studi wa not complet understood . In outbreak of the h9n2 viru in iran , a mix infect caus sever clinic featur with bacteria or mycoplasma [ 27 ] . In addit , kishida et al . reveal that co-infect with streptococcu or haemophilu increas the virul of h9n2 virus in chicken [ 28 ] . henc , the same secondari pathogen may be relat to sever pathogen and isol of the viru from novel sourc such as chicken product . So far , the preval of multipl h9n2 genotyp in mainland china ha been report [ 2 , 16â­18 ] . previous , liu et al . show that all eight segment of h9n2 virus isol in china between 1995 and 1999 genet belong to ck/hk/g9/97 lineag [ 20 ] . thereaft , multipl genotyp of the h9n2 virus have been gener from complic reassort with variou virus [ 18 ] . In thi studi , the multipl genotyp of h9n2 virus , which includ the genotyp isol from onli duck [ 2 ] , were detect in chicken product import from china . interestingli , most genotyp of the poultri product origin from onli one provinc ; genotyp iii onli in shandong , IV from liaon , V onli in shanghai , and VI onli in jilin . In contrast , genotyp I origin from shanghai and shandong and genotyp II from shenzhen or jilin . thi may suggest that there is a preval genotyp in each provinc , and that it may be relat to the emerg of novel genotyp h5n1 virus [ 2 , 6 ] . the amino-acid substitut , which confer re- sistanc to amantadin in the M2 region [ 23 ] , were detect in two isol ( ck/os/aq19/01 and ck/yo/ aq45/02 isol in shenzhen and shandong respect- ive ) . these isol were obtain from chicken product with an unknown histori of amantadin antivir therapi . As previous suggest [ 18 ] , thi mutat may be the result of the applic of amantadin for avian influenza treatment , and there may be a wide distribut of thi resist strain to these drug in mainland china . continu sur- veillanc of avian influenza virus in thi region is need . acknowledg thi work wa partial support by a grant-in-aid from the zoonos control project of the ministri of agricultur , forestri and fisheri , japan . declar OF interest none . note supplementari inform accompani thi paper on the journal 's websit ( http : //journals.cambridg . org ) . refer 1 . bank J , et al . phylogenet analysi of influenza A virus of H9 haemagglutinin subtyp . avian patholog 2000 ; 29 : 353â­360 . 2 .
