A survey of avian influenza virus wa conduct on tree sparrow ( passer montanu ) collect in china in 2004 . four virus were isol from free-liv tree sparrow . the result of the whole-genom analysi indic that an h5n1 viru with a new genotyp is circul among tree sparrow . the hemagglutinin and neuraminidas gene of the new genotyp were deriv from gs/gd/96-like virus and the nuclear protein gene descend from the 2001 genotyp A h5n1 virus , while the other inner gene origin from an unknown influenza viru . In experiment infect , all four virus were highli pathogen to chicken but not pathogen to duck or mice . the four tree sparrow virus were differ from the 2003 tree sparrow strain ( genotyp Z ) in hong kong . the result suggest that h5n1 virus might be distribut wide in tree sparrow . highli pathogen h5n1 influenza viru ha caus seriou poultri loss , and sinc 1997 it ha been report to caus human death . It ha been determin that h5n1 influenza virus have undergon reassort in recent year ( 12 , 17 ) . the hong kong influenza h5n1 viru that infect human in 1997 wa confirm to be a reassort viru that had acquir the hemagglutinin ( HA ) gene from a/goose/guangdong/1/96 ( gs/gd/96 ; h5n1 ) -like virus , the neuraminidas ( NA ) gene from a/teal/hongkong/w312/97 ( teal/hk/w312/97 ; h6n1 ) - like virus , and the intern gene from a/quail/hongkong/ g1/97 ( qa/hk/g1/97 ; h9n2 ) -like or teal/hk/w312/97 virus ( 1 , 5 ) . multipl genotyp of h5n1 were detect from 2001 to 2004 , which were design A , B , C , D , E , V , W , X , Y , Z , and Z ( 6 , 12 ) . sinc 2002 , genotyp Z ha been the domin h5n1 viru in southern china and wa respons for the 2003-2004 outbreak in asia ( 12 ) . although the aquat bird ha been consid a natur reservoir for avian influenza virus ( 20 ) , in recent year h5n1 virus have also been isol from terrestri bird . from 2002 to 2004 , genotyp Z virus were isol from a feral pigeon ( columba livia ) , a tree sparrow ( passer montanu ) , and a peregrin falcon ( falco peregrinu ) ( 12 ) , and two genotyp V virus were isol from crow in japan ( 13 ) . the systemat surveil of avian h5n1 influenza virus in resid bird ha not been well establish . As the tree sparrow is a veri common terrestri bird in china and ha frequent contact with human , we conduct a survey of epidem avian influenza virus in tree sparrow in the henan provinc of china in 2004 . four h5n1 avian influenza virus were isol . all the virus were sequenc , and their pathogen to chicken , duck , and mice were test . the result indic that they were new-genotyp h5n1 virus and highli pathogen to chicken . materi and method viru isol . A survey of epidem avian influenza viru in tree sparrow wa conduct in pingyu countri in the henan provinc of china in may 2004 . cloacal swab were collect from 38 captur free-liv tree sparrow and were elut with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buff salin ( pb ) . after centrifug at 6,000 g/min for 5 min at 4â°c , the supernat wa identifi by sandwich enzyme-link immunosorb assay with an avian influenza viru antigen de- tection kit ( keqian ltd. ) . the antigen-posit supernat of cloacal swab wa mix with an equal volum of pb contain antibiot ( penicillin G , 4,000 u/ml ; streptomycin sulfat , 800 u/ml ) for 4 h at 4â°c and wa inocul into the allanto caviti of 10-day-old , specific-pathogen-fre , embryon egg ( bei- jing merial ltd. ) . after incub at 37â°c for 48 to 72 h , the allanto fluid of the inocul egg wa collect . fifti percent egg infecti dose ( eid50 ) titer were calcul by the method of reed-muench . allanto fluid contain viru stock had been store at 70â°c befor be use . rna extract and nucleotid sequenc . viral rna wa extract from virus-infect allanto fluid with trizol reagent ( invitrogen ) . the cdna were amplifi by the takara rtaq enzym ( takara bio ) with avian influenza viru primer ( 10 ) . after be purifi with montag pcr cleanup filter plate ( mil- lipor corpor ) , the pcr product were use for sequenc with an am- ersham ET dye termin kit ( amersham pharmacia bio ) and abi prism 370 dna sequenc ( PE appli biosystem ) . the sequenc primer were avail- abl at the websit http : //www.genomics.org.cn/ai/index.jsp . all sequenc data were edit by bioedit version 5.0.9 and align by clustal X ( version 1.8 ) . phylogenet tree were gener with mega version 2.0 . pathogen test . To determin the pathogen of the viru isol , the virus were inocul into chicken , duck , and mice . group of eight specific- pathogen-fre , 6-week-old chicken ( beij merial ltd. ) were test accord- ing to the recommend of the offic intern de E â´pizooti ( oie ) . each chicken wa intraven inject with 0.2 ml of a 1:10 dilut of allanto fluid contain viru , and mortal wa observ over a 10-day period . group of eight 3-week-old duck were inocul intranas with 0.1 ml of allanto fluid , and mortal wa also observ over a 10-day period . group of 10 6- to * correspond author . mail address for T.

On the third day , three mice of each group were kill purpos , and the eid50 of the virus in the lung and brain were determin . the remain- ing mice were monitor daili for mortal . all the anim experi were perform in a biosafeti level 3 laboratori , and the inocul viral dose of the allanto fluid were 105.5 to 106.5 eid50 . control group of chicken , duck , and mice were inocul with pb . nucleotid sequenc access number . all sequenc have been deposit in genbank . the access number are ay741215 to ay741222 and dq073399 to dq073422 . result viru isol and molecular character . among the 38 cloacal swab from captur free-liv tree sparrow , 25 test avian influenza viru antigen posit by enzyme-link immunosorb assay . these 25 sampl were inocul into embryon egg , and four avian influenza virus were iso- late . they were name a/tre sparrow/henan/1/04 ( h5n1 ) ( ts/hn/1/04 ) to a/tre sparrow/henan/4/04 ( h5n1 ) ( ts/hn/ 4/04 ) . each of eight gene segment of the four virus wa sequenc . the four isol share a high homolog with each other ( 96 % to 99 % ) , except in their NA and pb2 gene . for the NA gene , onli ts/hn/4/04 did not contain a 20-amino-acid ( aa ) delet in the stalk of the NA molecul , so the homolog between ts/hn/4/04 and other sparrow virus wa low ( 91 % to 92 % ) . the homolog between the pb2 gene of ts/hn/2/04 and ts/hn/3/04 wa 99 % , but the homolog between ts/hn/ 1/04 and ts/hn/2/04 ( or ts/hn/3/04 ) wa 91 % , while that between ts/hn/4/04 and ts/hn/2/04 ( or ts/hn/3/04 ) wa 95 % . nucleotid sequenc analysi reveal that they origi- nate from differ sourc ( tabl 1. ) . the HA gene from the four tree sparrow all have the same multipl basic amino acid ( rrkkr ) at the connect pep- tide between ha1 and ha2 , which wa consid a charac- terist of influenza virus that are highli pathogen for chicken ( 11 ) . all amino acid relev to receptor bind ( aa 91 , 130 to 134 , 149 , 151 , 179 , 186 , 190 to 191 , and 220 to 225 ) were ident to those of gs/gd/1/96 ( 3 ) . therefor , it is like that these virus bind to cellular receptor with 2,3-neuacgal linkag , as ha been shown for gs/gd/1/96 ( 7 ) . the HA protein of ts/hn/1/04 , ts/hn/2/04 , and ts/hn/ 3/04 had an addit glycosyl site ( aa 170 to 172 ) at the head of the HA molecul and contain a 20-aa delet in the stalk of the NA molecul , while ts/hn/4/04 did not . the ad- dition glycosyl site in the HA protein and the delet of 20 aa in the NA protein were also domin in other 2004 virus isol from poultri and human , which wa suggest to be connect with the adapt of virus for spread more effici in terrestri domest poultri ( 15 ) . four tree sparrow virus had a 5-aa delet ( aa 80 to 84 ) in the middl of the NS molecul but did not have a mutat of glu92 in the ns1 protein or lys627 in the pb2 protein , which had been suggest to be associ with the increas virul of h5n1 virus in mice ( 4 , 8 ) . moreov , the four virus did not have mutat at the amino acid ser31 , leu26 , val27 , and ala30 in the transmembran region of the M2 protein , which occur in mani genotyp Z virus and which have been prove to be associ with amantadin resist ( 18 ) . phylogenet analysi . phylogenet analysi reveal that the HA gene of tree sparrow form a branch in the phylo- genet tree with 2000-2004 isol from asia ( genotyp Z , Z , Y , A , B , C , D , E , and X ) . the hk/97 isol form anoth branch . both branch origin from gs/gd/96-like virus ( fig . 1 ) . the NA gene tree show that tree sparrow branch with genotyp A , B , C , D , E , X , Y , Z , and Z and with gs/gd/96 and form a branch of avian influenza virus . isol of hk/97 form a separ branch . unlik the other three tree sparrow isol , ts/hn/02 cluster into the branch of geno- type Y , Z , and Z virus of 2002 to 2004 ( fig . 1 ) . analysi of the intern protein gene show that four h5n1 sparrow virus origin from multipl avian influenza vi- ruse . the pb2 gene of ts/hn/2/04 and ts/hn/3/04 were almost ident , but they were differ from ts/hn/1/04 and ts/hn/4/04 . ts/hn/1/04 and ts/hn/4/04 form a branch to- gether with genotyp A , B , C , D , E , Y , Z , Z , and X and with gs/gd/96 . thi branch wa distinctli relat to the branch of ts/hn/2/04 and ts/hn/3/04 and the branch of h5n1/97 ( fig . 1 ) . interestingli , the pb2 gene of dk/yolohama/aq10/03 , which wa a genotyp uniqu h5n1 influenza viru iso- late from duck meat in 2003 ( 14 ) , wa found to be most close relat to that of the tree sparrow ( fig . 1 ) . In the phylogenet tree of the pb1 gene , the four sparrow virus form a separ fork and cluster with the branch of genotyp A , B , C , D , E , Y , Z , and Z and the branch of gs/gd/96 and hk/97 . accord to the phylogenet tree , the pb1 gene of tree sparrow might be the ancestor of genotyp A , B , C , D , E , Y , Z , and Z and of gs/gd/96 and hk/97 . the pb1 gene of genotyp X is distinctli relat to those of all the above-nam genotyp ( fig . 1 ) . In the phylogenet tree of the PA gene , the four sparrow virus form a separ branch . the branch wa distinctli relat to the branch of genotyp A , B , C , D , E , Y , Z , Z , and X and to the branch of gs/gd/96 , the branch of h5n1/97 , and that of gf/hk/38/02 ( fig . 1 ) . In the phylogenet tree of the NP gene , the four sparrow virus form a separ fork and cluster with the branch of genotyp B , C , E , Y , Z , Z , and X , the branch of hk/97 , and that of dk/yolohama/aq10/03 ( 14 ) . the NP gene of the above-nam genotyp were similar to those of genotyp A and gs/gd/96 but distinctli relat to that of genotyp D ( fig . 1 ) . tabl 1 . percentag of sequenc similar between the tree sparrow viru isol and other influenza virus segment viru with the highest similaritya % similar pb2 a/pheasant/ireland/pv18/97 ( h9n2 ) 94 pb1 a/swine/hong kong/126/82 ( h3n2 ) 94 PA a/swine/hong kong/81/78 ( h3n2 ) 94 HA a/chicken/jilin/9/04 ( h5n1 ) 97 NP a/duck/hong kong/289/78 ( h9n2 ) 98 NA a/duck/guangxi/50/01 ( h5n1 ) 96 M a/duck/hong kong/698/79 ( h5n3 ) 98 NS a/duck/hong kong/610/79 ( h9n2 ) 98 a percentag of sequenc similar were calcul base on the nucleotid sequenc of the complet open read frame of eight gene , with ts/hn/2/04 as the repres strain . the nucleotid sequenc of ts/hn/2/04 were com- pare to those in genbank . vol . 79 , 2005 h5n1 virus isol from tree sparrow IN china 15461 15462 kou ET AL .

In the phylogenet tree of the M gene , the four sparrow virus form a separ branch with H3 and H6 subtyp virus . the branch wa distinctli relat to the branch of genotyp A , B , C , D , E , X , Y , Z , and Z , that of gs/gd/96 , and that of hk/97 ( fig . 1 ) . the NS gene of four tree sparrow were distinctli relat to that of genotyp A , B , C , D , E , X , Y , Z , and Z , that of h5n1/97 , and that of the H3 , H4 , H6 , H9 , and h11 subtyp ( fig . 1 ) . accord to the above-describ analysi of phylogenet relationship , the four tree sparrow isol were differ from other report h5n1 genotyp . they were reassort of gs/gd/96-like virus ; the outer gene are deriv form gs/ gd/96-like virus , and the inner gene are deriv from un- known influenza virus resid in wild bird ( fig . 1 ) . pathogen test . four isol from tree sparrow were inocul into chicken , duck , and mice . As shown in tabl 2 , all the isol kill seven or eight out of eight infect chicken within 10 day . accord to the oie criteria , all the isol were highli pathogen to chicken . It wa report that pathogen to duck vari accord to differ h5n1 isol ( 16 ) . the result of anim experi indic that the tree sparrow isol were not pathogen to duck ( tabl 2 ) and so were differ from the highli pathogen virus isol from wild aquat bird in 2002 ( 16 ) . In the mice experi , although the virus were unabl to kill mice , they could be detect in all the lung of mice examin , as well as in the brain of mice infect with ts/hn/2/04 ( ta- ble 2 ) . discuss A survey of epidem avian influenza virus in tree sparrow wa conduct in pingyu countri , henan provinc , china , in may 2004 . four virus were isol from 38 free-liv tree sparrow and were identifi to be the highli pathogen h5n1 subtyp avian influenza viru . By molecular character and an analysi of phylogenet relationship , their genet character were differ from those of the domin genotyp Z virus and other h5n1 genotyp virus . accord- ing to phylogenet analysi result , onli the HA , NA , and NP gene were found connect with other report genotyp virus . the HA and NA gene are descend from gs/gd/ 96-like viru , while the NP gene might be from genotyp A virus ( fig . 1 and 2 ) . but other inner gene , such as pb2 , pb1 , PA , M , and NS , were novel and might have origin from an unknown viru ( fig . 1 and 2 ) . the pb2 gene of dk/yolohama/ aq10/03 might also have origin from thi unknown viru . the possibl deriv of the tree sparrow virus and their relationship to other h5n1 genotyp are summar in fig . 2 . reassort were found to be veri popular in the origin of influenza virus ( 12 ) . In 2003 , an avian influenza h5n1 viru wa isol onc from a tree sparrow in hong kong , and the genotyp of thi strain wa Z . the tree sparrow virus that we isol were quit differ from the genotyp Z viru . the fact that a divers of h5n1 virus wa isol from tree sparrow sug- gest that h5n1 virus might be distribut wide in tree sparrow and that infect might not be occasion case . the aquat bird of the world were consid the natur reser- voir of influenza A virus . recent , genotyp V and Z h5n1 virus were isol from differ terrestri bird ( 12 ) . our fig . 2 . possibl deriv of the tree sparrow virus and their relationship to other h5n1 genotyp . the eight gene segment in each schemat viru particl are ( from top to bottom ) the pb2 , pb1 , PA , HA , NP , NA , M , and NS gene . gene of the same lineag are shown in the same color . the capit letter indic the genotyp and sparrow 1 to sparrow 4 indic the four sparrow isol . tabl 2 . result of anim infect experi viru titer ( log10 eid50 ) avian infect ( no . dead/no . inocul ) ( no . of day to death ) mous infect chicken duck No . dead/ no . inocul viru in lung ( log10 eid50 ) viru in brain ( log10 eid50 ) ts/hn/1/04 6 8/8 ( 2â­5 ) 0/8 0/10 1.4 No ts/hn/2/04 6 8/8 ( 3â­4 ) 0/8 0/10 2.1 1.0 ts/hn/3/04 5.5 7/8 ( 6â­9 ) 0/8 0/10 1.8 No ts/hn/4/04 6.5 8/8 ( 4â­5 ) 0/8 0/10 1.3 No vol . 79 , 2005 h5n1 virus isol from tree sparrow IN china 15465 result indic that a new genotyp h5n1 viru wa found in tree sparrow . multipl genotyp of virus isol from ter- restrial bird indic that terrestri bird may play an im- portant role in the natur reservoir and transmiss of influ- enza viru . the tree sparrow from which the viru wa isol appear normal when captur , indic that they were carrier of the virus instead of dead end host . the origin of the tree sparrow virus is unclear . the simi- lariti of the HA and NA gene with those of gs/gd/96 indi- cate that they had some connect with aquat bird . when migrat bird fli to their habit , virus that they have can be transmit to local aquat and terrestri bird . In con- trast , migrat bird can be infect by the virus reserv in resid bird . So , viral gene are transmit between the migrat gene pool and resid gene pool , and new-genotyp virus are creat . tree sparrow are in close contact with aquat bird and domest poultri ; therefor , the chanc of viral infect from other bird is high . the result of anim experi indic that the tree sparrow isol were highli pathogen to chicken but not pathogen to duck . In mice experi , the virus did not kill mice but were detect in the lung as well as some of the brain . nowaday , the mechan of the transmiss of avian influenza virus to mammal is not resolv and wa propos to involv multipl viral gene . It is firmli believ that avian gene constel promot transmiss to mam- mal ( 19 , 21 ) . the possibl transmiss and adapt to mammal need to be further studi . highli pathogen h5n1 avian influenza virus result in a windstorm of diseas outbreak in china and other asian countri in 2004 . As there were case in which virus were fatal to human ( 2 , 9 ) , the virus have been a seriou threat to the public health and the poultri industri . wild bird were consid to be significantli relat to the increas spread of the viru in asia , and h5n1 virus with pandem potenti becom endem in region and were not easili eradic ( 12 ) . tree sparrow are resid and widespread in the whole of china and other eurasian countri . they are more or less attach to human habit and are found to have close contact with poultri , wild bird , domest anim , and human be . As h5n1 virus were isol from these bird , pre- caution is need to prevent potenti threat to the poultri industri and human health . In the region of china where the h5n1 virus in thi studi were isol , pig and duck are hous close in farm villag . By mean of possibl trans- mission between swine and bird , the exist of the h5n1 viru in tree sparrow may serv as a new reservoir for the reemerg of a highli pathogen avian influenza viru h5n1 outbreak . addit survey , especi long-term sur- veillanc of tree sparrow and other wild bird , are necessari . acknowledg thi research wa support by the ministri of scienc and tech- nolog of china program ( grant no . 2004ba519a11 ) , the 973 project ( grant no . 2005cb523000 ) , the innov program ( grant no . inf105-sdb-3-a2 ) of the chines academi of scienc ( ca ) , the 863 project ( grant no . 2005 aa219070 ) , and the innov program of the institut of zoolog , ca .
