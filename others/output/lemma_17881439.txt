In contrast , the mutant se- lect with vn04-2 were resist sole to vn04-02 , which , therefor , could not be assign to ani epitop on the basi of the HI test . the mutant select with mab vn04-13 and 777/1 ( group 3 ) exhibit a complex pattern of specif that overlap both epitop defin by group 1 and group 2 mab . two mutant select with vn04-13 differ in their reaction . wherea mutant m13 ( 13 ) fail to react with vn04-8 and vn04-15 , mutant m13 ( 16 ) react with both , but not with mab vn04-9 . Of the mutant select by mab to a/vietnam/1203/04 viru , onli m2 ( 1 ) , m2 ( 4 ) , and m15 ( 20 ) re- act with mab 777/1 ( tabl 1 ) . the data demonstr that the reaction of mab vn04-9 , vn04-10 , and vn04-16 overlap , suggest that these mab react with the same antigen site , wherea mab vn04-8 and vn04-15 react with a differ antigen deter- minant . mab vn04-2 had an extrem narrow specif and therefor could not be assign to either epitop group on the basi of HI data alon . mab vn04-13 and 777/1 could not be assign to either group for the opposit reason : they fail to react with mutant select by the mab belong to either group . thi result suggest that they had unusu broad epitop specif . sequenc analysi of the escap mutant . To identifi the specif amino acid that react with the mab , we sequenc the HA gene . We found that the escap mutant carri either one or two amino acid chang in the ha1 subunit but none in the ha2 subunit . the mutat select by group 1 mab ( vn04-9 , vn04- 10 , and vn04-16 ) were locat between posit 155 and 166 , correspond to a part of antigen site B in H3 HA and to the site Sa in H1 HA . mab vn04-2 also recogn thi site , becaus it select mutant carri amino acid chang at posit 126 , 155 , and 166 . the amino acid substitut se- lect by group 2 mab ( vn04-8 and vn04-15 ) were locat in the 140-145 loop , that is , in the site correspond to anti- genic site A in H3 HA ( tabl 1 ) . two mab select escap mutant with unusu pattern of amino acid chang . mab vn04-13 select two mutant with amino acid chang in two wide separ area . the mutant m13 ( 13 ) carri the substitut s145f in the loop , which explain it inabl to react with mab vn04-8 and vn04- 15 . the other mutant , m13 ( 16 ) , had no substitut in thi site but carri two mutat ( d187n and k193e ) in a region correspond to a part of site B in H3 HA . the substitut k193e wa clearli antigen signific , becaus mab vn04-13 fail to react with the mutant m9 ( 6 ) , which also carri thi substitut . further , philpott et al . ( 17 ) have re- port an amino acid chang at posit 193 in an H5 escap mutant . mab 777/1 also recogn amino acid substitut in two distantli locat antigen site : the region correspond to site B in H3 HA ( posit 156 and 193 ) and posit 145 in the loop . howev , both mutant select with mab 777/1 had a substitut at posit 145 : s145p in mutant m777/1 ( 2 ) and s145t in mutant m777/1 ( 4 ) . clearli , epitop react with mab vn04-13 and 777/1 overlap two antigen site , one correspond to site A and one correspond to site B in H3 HA . the other mab ex- hibit narrow specif , select escap mutant with amino acid chang in site correspond to either antigen site A in H3 ( mab vn04-8 and vn04-15 ) or site B in H3 and site Sa in H1 ( mab vn04-2 , vn04-9 , vn04-10 , and vn04-16 ) . each of three escap mutant -- m2 ( 1 ) , m9 ( 6 ) , and m13 ( 16 ) -- that were select with three differ mab were doubl mu- tant carri two HA amino acid chang . the HI data did not allow us to ascrib ani antigen effect to the substitut t160a and d187n or to discern whether the antigen chang of mutant m2 ( 1 ) wa caus by substitut s126i or i155t . howev , all of these substitut are locat in antigen area , and their effect on antigen specif can not be exclud . HI test of the anti-a/vietnam/1203/04 mab with escap mutant of a/mallard/pennsylvania/10218/84 viru . all of the mab except vn04-8 react with the a/mallard/pennsylva- nia/10218/84 ( h5n2 ) viru , allow us to use singl , doubl , and tripl escap mutant of thi viru gener and charac- teriz in our previou studi ( 10 ) to further examin the spec- ific of the mab . In HI test mab vn04-2 fail to react with mutant have the amino acid substitut n129d ( tabl 2 ) . the reaction of mab vn04-9 , vn04-10 , and vn04-16 were affect by amino acid chang at posit 156 , which wa expect on the basi of the data of the sequenc of the escap mutant select with these mab ( tabl 1 ) . howev , mab vn04-10 lost the abil to react with mutant carri the k156n substitut and yet retain reactiv with those tabl 2 . reaction of mab with escap mutant of a/mallard/pennsylvania/10218/84 ( h5n2 ) viru in HI assay escap mutant HA amino acid changea reactiv with mabb : H3 number H5 number vn04-2 vn04-9 vn04-10 vn04-13 vn04-15 vn04-16 777/1 m46 ( 7 ) n129d n124d 0 0 0 0 0 0 m46 ( 8 ) k157m k153m 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 m55 ( 2 ) k156n k152m 0 0 0 4 m58 ( 1 ) d131n d126n 0 2 0 1 m24b9 r144g r140g 0 0 0 0 0 0 m46 ( 7 ) -55 n129d , k156t n124d , k152t 0 0 2 0 m46 ( 7 ) -55-24b9 n129m , k156t , p140l n124d , k152t , p136l 2 2 m55 ( 2 ) -24b9 k156n , n142k k152t , n138k 0 0 m58 ( 1 ) -24b9 d131n , s145p d126n , s141p 0 2 a see tabl 1 , footnot a. b design are the same as in tabl 1 . valu are the differ in log2 unit between the HI titer of mab in the reaction with the wild-typ a/mallard/ pennsylvania/10218/84 ( h5n2 ) viru and with it escap mutant . vol . 81 , 2007 antigen epitop OF influenza h5n1 viru HA 12913 carri k156t . reaction of vn04-15 were affect not onli by chang in the loop correspond to site A in H3 HA ( p140l , n142k , and r144g ) but also by the chang d131n , locat in the site correspond to site B in the H3 HA , which gener a new glycosyl site ( 10 ) . reaction of the escap mutant with mab 777/1 wa abolish by the amino acid substitut s145p and reduc by the substitut k156n , confirm the abil of thi mab to react with epitop in two differ antigen site . the result obtain with escap mutant of both a/viet- nam/1203/04 ( h5n1 ) and a/mallard/pennsylvania/10218/84 ( h5n2 ) virus allow us to divid the mab into three group on the basi of their epitop recognit . group 1 mab ( vn04-2 , vn04-9 , vn04-10 , and vn04-16 ) react with the complex epitop compris part of antigen site B of the H3 HA and site Sa of H1 HA . group 2 mab ( vn04-8 and vn04-15 ) react with the epitop correspond to antigen site A in H3 . howev , mab vn04-15 is also sensit to the acquisit of the glycosyl site at posit 131 . group 3 mab ( vn04-13 and 777/1 ) recogn amino acid chang in two distantli locat antigen site . figur 1 show a sche- matic represent of the epitop of the mab overlap two antigen site . cross-react of the anti-a/vietnam/1203/04 mab with highli pathogen h5n1 virus . In HI test , both the h5n1 virus preced a/vietnam/1203/04 viru and those isol later were resist to some mab in the panel ( tabl 3 ) . these strain exhibit differ from one anoth and from a/vietnam/1203/04 ( h5n1 ) viru in their reaction with the mab . the reaction wa either slightli enhanc compar to the reaction with a/vietnam/1203/04 ( h5n1 ) viru , or de- creas , or complet abolish . the differ did not co- incid with clade and subclad divis base on phylogenet analysi of the H5 HA gene . We compar the amino acid sequenc in the ha1 polypeptid chain region that show amino acid chang in the escap mutant ( posit 125 to 193 ) ( tabl 4 ) . In sever case the amino acid chang were posit ident in the nonreact strain and in the escap mutant of a/vietnam/1203/04 and a/mallard/pennsyl- vania/10218/84 virus . the nonreact or reduc reactiv of the strain a/chicken/jogiakarta/bbvet-ix/04 and a/duck/ laos/3295/06 with mab vn04-8 and vn04-15 ( tabl 3 ) may be explain by nonconserv amino acid differ be- tween a/vietnam/1203/04 viru and these strain in the region of the loop ( tabl 4 ) . the failur of a/duck/laos/3295/06 to react with the mab vn04-13 can be ascrib to the substitu- tion s145f , which wa observ in the mutant m15 ( 17 ) and m58 ( 1 ) -24b9 that did not react with thi mab . the strain that were nonreact with mab vn04-2 ( tabl 3 ) had an aspart acid residu at posit 129 ( tabl 4 ) , as did the mutant fig . 1 . schemat represent of the antigen site and the epitop that react with mab vn04-13 ( A ) and 777/1 ( B ) on the globular head of the HA H5 HA molecul . imag were creat with rasmol 2.6 , and the HA structur wa obtain from the protein data bank ( pdb access number 1jsm ) . amino acid posit are des- ignat in H3 number . tabl 3 . cross-react of anti-a/vietnam/1203/04 ( h5n1 ) HA mab with h5n1 virus HA phylogeni viru reactiv with maba : vn04-2 vn04-8 vn04-9 vn04-10 vn04-13 vn04-15 vn04-16 clade 1 a/vietnam/1194/04 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 a/hong kong/213/03 0 1 0 2 1 1 clade 2A , subclad 1 a/chicken/indonesia/pa/03 3 1 0 2 0 0 a/chicken/malang/bbvet-iv/04 1 1 0 2 0 0 a/chicken/jogjakarta/bbvet-ix/04 0 1 2 clade 2E , subclad 2 a/whoop swan/mongolia/244/05 0 0 2 0 2 clade 2F , subclad 3 a/duck/laos/3295/06 3 0 3 a design are the same as in tabl 1 . valu are the differ in log2 unit between the HI titer of mab in the reaction with the a/vietnam/1203/04 viru and with the other h5n1 virus . 12914 kaverin ET AL .

It is worth note that the distribut of antigen signific amino acid chang in the HA of the h5n1 strain wa not relat to ha-bas clade and subclad ( tabl 3 and 4 ) . discuss We have describ the first character of the antigen structur of the HA of a highli pathogen h5n1 viru through the select and studi of escap mutant . the evolut of highli pathogen h5n1 strain ha to date been monitor by sequenc the genom of isol and use polyclon sera and mab to detect antigen chang . our result will refin the detect of antigen import chang in the evolv- ing H5 HA . the locat and structur of influenza viru HA antigen epitop wa first character in 1981 in the three-dimen- sional model of the H3 subtyp ( 29 ) . four antigen site were describ ( A , B , C , and D ) , and a fifth ( E ) wa later demon- strate ( 21 ) . the antigen site of H1 and H2 subtyp ha were then character and map on the H3 HA three- dimension structur ( 1 , 27 ) , and a preliminari map of the H5 HA antigen site wa also base on the x-ray model of H3 HA ( 17 ) . the locat of five H5 HA antigen epitop were identifi , but their size and fine structur wa not describ , becaus onli six amino acid chang were observ . after the x-ray crystallograph structur of H5 and H9 molecul were report ( 6 , 7 ) , we map the antigen site on their surfac by gener and analyz escap mutant ( 10 , 11 ) . amino acid chang in the escap mutant of the low-pathogen avian a/mallard/pennsylvania/10218/84 ( h5n2 ) viru were group in two area in the HA molecul : one correspond to antigen site A in H3 HA ( a loop at the side of HA molecul ) and anoth correspond to a part of antigen site B in the H3 HA molecul and partial overlap the anti- genic site Sa in H1 HA . the recent extens spread of highli pathogen influenza h5n1 virus sinc 2003 prompt us to character the antigen structur of the H5 HA use the human isol a/vietnam/1203/04 ( h5n1 ) , which repres clade 1 on the H5 HA phylogenet tree . We identifi sever import differ between a recent h5n1 strain and the previous describ H5 HA molecul ( 10 , 17 ) . first , the posit of amino acid chang in the escap mutant of the a/vietnam/1203/04 ( h5n1 ) viru dif- fere from those we previous describ in a/mallard/penn- sylvania/10218/84 ( h5n2 ) mutant ( 10 ) , with the except of posit 144 , 145 , and 156 , although they are locat within the same area on the surfac of the HA molecul . second , when the posit coincid , the amino acid chang are dif- ferent ( e.g. , k156e and k156n ) . all of these observ are like to reflect a differ in HA conform between the more recent h5n1 strain and a/mallard/pennsylvania/ 10218/84 ( h5n2 ) viru . the amino acid chang in posit previous unreport in escap mutant ( 126 , 143 , 155 , 160 , 166 ) that alter the reactiv with the mab were locat both in the loop and in the part correspond to antigen site B of H3 HA . interestingli , in the present studi and in our previou studi ( 10 ) , all antigen signific amino acid substitut were locat exclus in area correspond to antigen site A and B of H3 HA and the antigen site Sa of H1 HA . not a singl mab against a/vietnam/1203/04 ( h5n1 ) , a/chicken/pennsylvania/10218/83 ( h5n2 ) , or a/chicken/ pennsylvania/8125/83 ( h5n2 ) virus in our studi select an escap mutant with amino acid chang in the area at the side of the HA molecul design as site 2 , 3 , and 4 by philpott et al . ( 17 ) . It seem plausibl that the repertoir of immuno- compet antibody-produc cell ( at least in mice ) is di- rect larg against the upper surfac of the H5 HA mole- cule . An unexpect find wa the abil of at least two mab to overlap wide separ antigen site . Of the two mutant select by mab vn04-13 , one had an amino acid chang ( s145f ) in the loop correspond to site A in H3 , while the tabl 4 . amino acid chang in HA of the h5n1 virus HA phylogeni viru amino acid at positiona : 125 129 133 142 144 145 158 159 160 163 166 178 185 193 120 124 129 138 140 141 154 155 156 159 162 174 181 189 clade 1 a/vietnam/1203/04 S S L Q K S N S T T R V P K a/vietnam/1194/04 S S L Q K S N S T T R V P K a/hong kong/213/03 N S L Q K S N N A T R V P R clade 2A , subclad 1 a/chicken/indonesia/pa/03 S D S Q K S N S A T R V P R a/chicken/malang/bbvet-iv/04 S N S Q K S N S A T R V P R a/chicken/jogjakarta/bbvet-ix/04 S D S L R S N S T I R V P K clade 2E , subclad 2 a/whoop swan/mongolia/244/05 S D S Q R S D N A T R V P R clade 2F , subclad 3 a/duck/laos/3295/06 S D S Q T P N N T T R I S K a amino acid number in the top row is base on H3 HA . amino acid number in the bottom row is base on H5 HA . amino acid substitut with respect to the HA of a/vietnam/1203/04 ( h5n1 ) are indic in boldfac . amino acid posit chang in the HA of escap mutant are indic in ital . vol . 81 , 2007 antigen epitop OF influenza h5n1 viru HA 12915 other carri 2 mutat in a region correspond to a part of site B in H3 . mab 777/1 also react with two antigen site , as demonstr by it reaction with escap mutant of a/vietnam/1203/04 ( h5n1 ) and a/mallard/pennsylvania/ 10218/84 ( h5n2 ) virus . with some reserv , mab vn04-15 may also be regard as sensit to amino acid substitut in two antigen site . howev , in thi case the amino acid chang at posit 131 wa associ with the acquisit of a new glycosyl site ( 10 ) . the oligosaccha- ride chain in thi posit might creat steric hindranc at the epitop recogn by the mab vn04-15 in the region of the loop . importantli , the mab overlap two antigen site ( vn04-13 and 777/1 ) were not mix prepar . amino acid chang that abolish recognit by these mab were de- tect in sever singl mutant carri a mutat in one antigen site , while the other site wa unchang and free to bind mab : the mutant , therefor , would have been neutral- ize by a mixtur contain a mab reactiv with the un- chang site . further , escap mutant are unlik to be se- lect by a mixtur of two mab react with differ antigen site , consid the mean frequenc of the muta- tion select by mab ( 31 ) . the abil of some anti-h5 mab to overlap 2 distinct antigen site may be hypothet explain by the archi- tectur of the H5 HA molecul . site A and B are situat far apart in the three-dimension structur of H3 HA molecul ( 29 ) but are much closer in H5 HA ( 10 , 11 ) . It would be prematur to specul whether thi proxim may influenc the select of antigen variant under natur condit . howev , a neutral antibodi that react with two antigen site rather than one might offer the evolv viru broader possibl of escap , if a mutat in either site could confer resist to neutral . the abil of some anti-h5 mab to overlap two differ antigen site suggest that if H5 virus were to becom dissemin in the human popul , the gener of drift variant of H5 HA might differ from that observ in the human H1 and H3 virus . the panel of mab we character is wide use to studi current circul highli pathogen h5n1 influenza virus ( 5 , 8 , 23 ) . these mab are avail from the biodefens and emerg infect research resourc repositori ( http : //www.beiresources.org ) , and in 2007 were includ into the cdc influenza reagent kit . By identifi the epitop recog- nize by these antibodi , our find allow the use of the mab to monitor the evolut of the antigen site in the current circul h5n1 virus . previou data obtain by use thi panel of mab can be reinterpret on the basi of our result , and the character of futur isol will acquir a new dimens , in which the antigen chang that are detect can be connect with amino acid substitut at specif antigen site . the antigen site describ here and in our earlier studi ( 10 ) are significantli involv in the evolut of h5n1 influ- enza virus . the site can now be analyz in detail . clearli , antigen specif can be modul by a greater varieti of amino acid chang than previous suggest ( 10 ) . the amino acid substitut in the highli pathogen h5n1 isol ( 4 , 24 ) occur within the antigen site describ here and in our previou studi ( 10 ) , and some occur in precis the same posit as those in the escap mutant describ here and in our previou studi ( 10 ) . these coincid suggest a certain similar between the evolut of the avian h5n1 virus and the antigen drift of human H1 and H3 influenza viru strain . the data present here may be regard as a basi for futur studi in sever direct . first , it will be import to explor whether the antigen epitop recogn by murin mab coincid with those recogn by human antibodi . the product of human mab against the H5 HA wa re- centli report ( 19 ) . second , sinc the distribut of the an- tigen signific amino acid chang in the HA of h5n1 strain did not coincid with the clade and subclad group base on phylogenet analysi of the H5 HA gene , the choic of a strain for vaccin prepar should take into consider- ation not onli the select of the proper clade and subclad but also the structur of antigen site of individu strain . It will be import to establish to what extent the amino acid substitut in the antigen site affect immun protect . final , last but not least , it will be of interest to find out whether the amino acid chang in the escap mutant of the h5n1 viru have ani pleiotrop effect . In our previou studi we reveal that escap mutat in the HA of a low-patho- genic mouse-adapt h5n2 and h9n2 strain may be asso- ciat with decreas of virul and/or the affin to sialic receptor ( 10 , 11 ) . experi aim at the character of these phenotyp featur of the escap mutant gener in the present studi are now in progress . acknowledg We thank sharon naron for editori assist .
