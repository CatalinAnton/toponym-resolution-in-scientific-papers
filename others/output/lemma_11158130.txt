No cross- hybrid could be detect beyond that expect from the limit degre of sequenc overlap between differ probe and target . At least 100 to 150 bp of homolog wa requir for hybrid under the condit use in thi studi . combin of cy3- and cy5-label dna can also be hybrid to the same chip , permit further differenti of amplifi molecul in complex mixtur . In a more realist test of the technolog , sever set of multiplex pcr primer that collect target influenza A and B viru strain were identifi and were use to type and subtyp sever previous unsequenc influenza viru isol . the result show that dna microarray technolog provid a use supplement to pcr-base diagnost method . after the first report describ dna microchip array ap- pear ( 15 , 16 ) , microarray technolog revolution the studi of gene express pattern in divers organ ( re- view in refer 3 and 7 ) . array compos of oligonucle- otid ( 15 ) or robot spot dna ( 16 ) permit genom scale analysi of gene express pattern and have more re- centli been use in such applic as drug discoveri ( 6 ) , mutat detect ( 8 , 9 , 12 ) , evolutionari studi ( 11 , 21 ) , and genom map ( 20 ) . the applic of dna microarray technolog as a diagnost tool also show great promis , sinc microarray theoret permit a simultan screen for ani of ten of thousand of nucleic acid sequenc . howev , onli recent have report of these array-bas applic start to appear . oligonucleotid array have been use to search for mutat in cancer-link gene ( review in refer 10 ) and human immunodefici viru mutat ( 13 , 25 ) and in bacteri type ( 1 ) , but the high cost and limit avail of such tool continu to limit research in thi area . We have been interest in the develop of new tech- nolog capabl of better identifi viral pathogen and have been use , as a model system , human influenza virus ( 28 , 29 ) . influenza virus caus annual recurr epidem of moderate-to-sever respiratori diseas , frequent associ with genet variat term drift and shift ( 5 , 27 ) . these virus present an import diagnost problem , and the rapid detect , type , and subtyp of influenza A and B viru strain are of both clinic and epidemiolog valu . while antibody-bas method still form the foundat of routin diagnost work , mani report over the last decad have dem- onstrat the util and superior of pcr-base diagnost ( 2 , 4 , 14 , 19 , 22 , 26 ) and retrospect ( 23 ) test . unfortun pcr-base method suffer from a problem in that simpli pro- duce dna is n't suffici evid that one ha amplifi the right product . other method such as dna sequenc ( 29 ) , blot ( 18 ) , and fluorogen pcr ( 19 ) are requir if one desir proof that a pcr ha amplifi a bona fide nucleic acid target . while such confirmatori method are certainli reliabl , they still present someth of a financi , technic , and logis- tical challeng to busi laboratori routin screen for hun- dred of differ agent . they also becom more difficult to appli when multiplex method are be use to simulta- neousli amplifi two or more pcr product from a mixtur of templat . dna array offer a potenti solut to these problem . the array can potenti encod ten of thousand of possibl target sequenc and thu provid a simpl way of store and index numer hybrid probe . In principl one could draw thi resourc when need to confirm the ident of one or more pcr product by hybrid , with onli minim modif to exist pcr-base protocol . We have test thi approach and show here that a model dna array can be use to type and subtyp influenza A and B viru strain . thi show that dna array can provid multipli re- dundant confirmatori evid that a pcr product encod the sequenc ( s ) it is expect to encod . materi and method virus . human influenza viru strain ( tabl 1 ) were obtain from the american type cultur collect ( manassa , va. ) and propag where nec- essari in 10-day-old embryon chicken egg ( 29 ) . crude viral rna wa extract as describ previous ( 29 ) and store at 70â°c . oligonucleotid primer design . oligonucleotid primer were design use rightprim , version 1.2 , softwar and genbank blastn sequenc align . select pcr primer meet the follow criteria : ( i ) primer hybrid to highli * correspond author . mail address : depart of molecular biolog and genet , univers of guelph , guelph , ontario n1g 2w1 , canada . phone : ( 519 ) 824-4120 , ext . 2575 . fax : ( 519 ) 837-2075 . e-mail : dhevan @ uoguelph.ca . 696 conserv sequenc element , ( ii ) each amplicon span approxim 500 bp , ( iii ) amplifi segment collect encompass an entir gene ( thu 1.5 kb of viru dna sequenc requir three primer pair ) , and ( iv ) primer melt point gener fell between 50 and 54â°c . desalt primer were purchas from gibco/brl and use without further purif . rt-pcr and cdna clone .

J. clin . microbiol . influenza viru strain also encod HA and NA gene , but onli a singl major genet variant of each is commonli encoun- tere . thu the type and subtyp of influenza A and B viru strain requir an abil to detect at least four HA and three NA gene plu their drift allel variant . other viral gene are also use in differenti influenza A and B viru strain and offer the advantag of be more genet stabl . In thi regard we have previous use the influenza matrix pro- tein ( MP ) gene as a pcr target . method capabl of differen- tiat a total of four HA , three NA , and two MP gene target thu provid the capac to type and subtyp human influenza A and B viru strain with some degre of redund . prepar of clone viru cdna . We initi clone mul- tipl separ fragment of gene for three influenza A viru ha ( a/ha1 , a/ha2 , and a/ha3 ) , two influenza A viru na ( a/na1 and a/na2 ) , and an influenza A viru MP ( a/mp ) as well as an influenza B viru HA ( b/ha ) , NA ( b/na ) , and MP ( b/mp ) . the nine gene each span 1 to 1.5 kb and have littl or no sequenc homolog . primer were select use a combin of primer design softwar and blastn sequenc align with the intent of locat each primer pair in maxim conserv sequenc region space about 500 base apart . tabl 2 list the nine dna sequenc use to initi homolog search and to design primer , and tabl 3 show the 52 primer gener by thi approach . base on avail sequenc data , the variat in nucleotid sequenc within each influenza gene famili rang from 81 to 100 % sequenc ident ( tabl 2 ) . these 26 primer pair were use in rt- pcr to amplifi gene encod by five differ influenza viru strain ( tabl 1 ) . We obtain 24 of 26 possibl cdna prod- uct ( the a/ha1-2 and b/mp-2 primer set did not work ) , clone these cdna , and verifi the dna sequenc . array fabric . the 24 sequence-valid cdna clone were reamplifi use m13 univers primer , in the process ad a 5 amino tag to the revers primer to permit coval attach to a modifi glass support . A custom-built stan- ford-typ dna array wa use to spot dna , in duplic , onto activ silyl glass slide at densiti of 1,100 or 2,500 spots/cm2 ( 300- or 200-m space , respect ) . the array pattern is shown in tabl 4 . In addit to viru cdna we ad control spot compos of escherichia coli dna and 3 ssc buffer . sever replic set of the eight-by-eight grid were also print elsewher on the slide to facilit statist analysi of hybrid signal . hybrid of array with clone cdna . To determin whether these array cdna target retain their expect hybrid properti , we first test whether fluoresc probe deriv from the origin clone cdna templat would hybrid to a cognat spot ( s ) . standard pcr mixtur were supplement with cy3-dctp and use to reamplifi each of the clone cdna . these fluoresc probe were purifi and individu hybrid to separ array , and then the hybrid signal were analyz use virtek or axon chip reader . A select of the result fluoresc imag are shown in fig . 1 ( panel 1 to 6 ) . these can be decod by note , for exampl , that a 520-bp a/ha3-1 probe ( tabl 3 ) produc strong hybrid signal at duplic spot lo- cate in row 3 , column 1 and 2 ( fig . 1 , panel 2 ) . overal , duplic hybrid signal were clearli detect at all of the posit known to encod homolog dna target and littl cross-hybrid to unrel spot or background flu- oresc wa detect with these support . the digit imag gener by fluoresc scanner can be veri mislead if judg just by eye , becaus the appear- anc vari greatli in respons to chang in instrument set- ting , background subtract , and postacquisit gain factor . therefor we also measur the hybrid signal intens and compar the differ in fluoresc intens between spot encod homolog versu nonhomolog target . ( thi ratio of fluoresc valu serv as a way of normal- ize data across mani differ array , with the cross-hybrid- izat background alway assign an arbitrari valu of 50 fluoresc unit . ) initi experi detect approxim threefold variat in signal intens , which seem to corre- late with chang in spot size ( data not shown ) . furthermor , array prepar earli in the product cycl produc the most-intens signal , while later batch of slide , encod smaller spot , produc weaker fluoresc signal . thi ef- fect wa caus by the array pin blunt with use , caus the spot to decreas in radiu from 75 to 45 m. thi should reduc the quantiti of bound dna approxim threefold ( 75/45 2 ) , which agre well with the observ variat in fluoresc intens . figur 2 show a repres select of result subsequ obtain from 10 separ hybrid experi use array bear primarili 45-m ( radiu ) spot . the signal intens still vari in these experi from target to target , rang from 180 to 1,090 arbitrari fluoresc unit , but the fluoresc intens measur at site encod homolog target sequenc were alway significantli greater ( at least threefold ) than the signal detect elsewher on the array at nonhomolog target . sever addit factor probabl contribut to the residu variat , includ variat in the concentr and spe- cific activ of fluoresc probe . howev , a signific confound factor appear to be the size of the target dna . effect of target length on signal intens . the primer use in thi studi were design to creat some overlap between the two or three target cdna deriv from ani given influenza viru gene . thi made it possibl to estim what minim target sequenc length might be requir to produc a hybrid- izat signal . for exampl , target a/ha2-1 and a/ha2-2 have 202 bp of common sequenc and , by hybrid a probe deriv from a/ha2-1 to these array , one can measur the rel effici of probe bind to target a/ha2-1 ( 513 homolog base pair ) or to a/ha2-2 ( 202 homolog base pair ) ( fig . 1 , panel 8 and 10 ) . the result deriv from thi analysi are shown in fig . 3 . gener it wa note that over- lap of less than 100 bp produc poor or no hybrid a/ha2-1 probe and cy5-label b/na-1 probe and scan simultan for cy3 ( panel 8 ) and cy5 ( panel 9 ) dye at excit wavelength of 543 and 635 nm , respect . for comparison , panel 10 show anoth array hybrid to a mixtur of cy3-label a/ha2-1 and b/na-1 probe . panel 11 and 12 illustr the use of multiplex rt-pcr and the abil to detect hybrid of heterolog a/denver/1/57 and b/hong kong/5/72 probe to a/port chalmers/1/73 and b/maryland/1/59 target . vol . 39 , 2001 dna array detect OF influenza virus 699 signal , suggest that thi repres the minim length of target requir under these condit . In contrast , overlap- ping sequenc in excess of 100 bp produc readili detect- abl fluoresc signal and the intens appear roughli depend on the length of the overlap region common to target and probe . To further test what effect longer target have on signal intens , we took advantag of the fact that other primer combin can be use to produc a cdna fragment span- ning two or more target dna in a singl rt-pcr . for ex- ampl , a reaction with primer 15 and 20 ( tabl 3 ) gener a 1,607-bp probe fragment span target a/ha3-1 ( 520 bp ) , a/ha3-2 ( 444 bp ) , and a/ha3-3 ( 707 bp ) . thi method of probe prepar ensur that differ in the concentra- tion and specif activ of probe were n't respons for variat in hybrid effici . As expect , thi now uniformli label dna hybrid to all three homolog target on a singl array ( fig . 1 , panel 7 ) , and again no signif- icant cross-hybrid wa detect . quantit of the flu- oresc signal show the rel intens ratio to be 1.2 ( a/ha3-1 ) to 1.0 ( a/ha3-2 ) to 2.1 ( a/ha3-3 ) , which follow the same trend as the rel size ratio ( 1.2 [ a/ha3-1 ] to 1.0 [ a/ha3-2 ] to 1.6 [ a/ha3-3 ] ) . therefor , as with tradit blot technolog , dna array produc hybrid sig- nal which are roughli proport to target size . hybrid use mix probe and multipl dye . A dou- ble-label experi wa also conduct to further test the discriminatori capac of these array . control experi show that a mixtur of cy3-label a/ha2-1 and b/na-1 probe hybrid to the expect a/ha2-1 and b/na-1 tar- get in a singl array ( fig . 1 , panel 10 ) produc fluoresc spot of compar intens . No cross-hybrid signal were detect beyond some addit bind to the a/ha2-2 locu ( the a/ha2-1 probe ha 202-bp homolog with an a/ha2-2 target ) . We then use differ fluoresc dye to prepar a/ha2-1 probe label with cy3-dctp and b/na-1 probe label with cy5-dctp . the probe were mix to- gether in equal amount and hybrid to the array , and the bound fluoresc probe were then detect use 543 ( cy3 ) and 635 nm ( cy5 ) as the excit wavelength . the two result imag are shown in fig . 1 , panel 8 and 9 . cy3- and cy5-label probe seem to hybrid with compar effi- cienci , produc fluoresc signal of compar inten- siti . moreov , the cy3-label a/ha2-1 probe hybrid onli to homolog a/ha2-1 and ( overlap ) a/ha2-2 tar- get and the cy-5-label b/na-1 probe hybrid to the b/na-1 target . these data show that one can differenti a mixtur of probe prepar use separ dye and thu deriv addit inform regard the probe composit . multiplex pcr . the preced experi show that influenza viru cdna array can be use to accur identifi differ model probe either singli or in mixtur . howev , the eventu goal of these experi is to improv on mul- tiplex method capabl of type and subtyp unknown vi- ruse . We thu screen our primer for primer combin that are compat in multiplex rt-pcr . In recognit of the fact that some gene combin are mutual exclus ( e.g. , a viru is either H1 or H2 but ca n't be both ) , primer combin that should produc a singl diagnost infor- mativ pcr product in a reaction with ani given type or subtyp of influenza viru were chosen . after test larg number of primer combin against a batteri of cdna templat , we eventu identifi three multiplex primer combin that collect type and subtyp influenza strain . these primer set are summar in tabl 5 . figur 4 show how these multiplex primer combin can select amplifi a particular gene target in reaction with one of the primer mixtur and a particular clone cdna target . for exampl , primer mixtur A ( tabl 5 ) amplifi an 510-bp a/ha1-1 product in a pcr with a clone a/ha1-1 templat ( fig . 4 , lane b ) as well as 490-bp a/ha2-3 , 700-bp a/ha3-3 , and 530-bp b/mp-1 product in pcr with a/ha2-3 , a/ha3-3 , and b/mp-1 templat , respect ( fig . 4 , lane e , h , and k ) . type and subtyp influenza virus by rt-pcr and array hybrid . In a now more realist test of thi method fig . 2 . quantit of hybrid signal . A glass background valu wa automat subtract from all measur fluoresc intens , and the mean intens and standard deviat ( n 4 ) were then calcul for each spot . To permit comparison between differ array and probe , the averag nonspecif cross-hybrid signal detemin at nonhomolog target wa assign an arbitrari valu of 50 fluoresc unit .

In thi paper we have shown that robot spot dna chip , when use in conjunct with multiplex pcr method , can be use to facilit type and subtyp human influenza virus . sinc the method exploit the specif of both pcr and dna hybrid reaction , it offer a degre of accuraci superior to those of mani other method commonli use to detect pcr-amplifi dna . thu it should be attract in situat , such as medic diagnost and forens , where further identif of a pcr-amplifi dna may be re- quir . the method is obvious applic to ani pathogen that can be clone and array and offer the advantag that one can detect and differenti dna contain in mixtur of fluoresc pcr product ( fig . 1 , panel 10 ) . thi suggest that dna array could streamlin the detect of multipl agent through parallel analysi of pool of pcr-amplifi dna . sever featur of gene chip , pcr , and fluoresc probe facilit the work outlin in thi paper . first , pcr is well known for it extraordinari sensit and can be use to gener larg quantiti of probe dna . second , nucleotide- link cy3 and cy5 dye are readili incorpor into pcr product without greatli interf with the effici of am- plific or the yield of the probe . third , these dye are intens fluoresc and hybrid is easili detect at level well abov background use modern confoc base array reader . final , the hybrid and wash protocol fig . 4 . multiplex pcr amplif of influenza A and B viru strain . the three multiplex primer set describ in tabl 5 were test for the capac to amplifi a singl , appropri size , dna product in reaction with the indic clone templat . for exampl , primer mixtur A ( tabl 5 ) produc a 510-bp product in a reaction with an a/ha1-1 templat ( lane b ) , a 490-bp product in a reaction with an a/ha2-3 templat ( lane e ) , primarili a 710-bp product in a reaction with an a/ha3-3 templat ( lane h ) , and a 530-bp product in a reaction with b/mp-1 templat ( lane k ) . pcr product were separ use a 1.2 % agaros gel and stain with ethidium bromid . fig . 5 . rt-pcr detect and differenti of influenza viru rna templat . the multiplex primer indic in tabl 5 were test for the capac to type and subtyp the indic influenza viru strain . probe were prepar in reaction mixtur contain crude viral rna , cy3-dctp , and an appropri multiplex primer mixtur and hybrid overnight to microarray . the signal intens wa cal- culat as describ in materi and method ( n 4 ) . signal mark with an asterisk deriv from perfectli match probe-and-target pair ( i.e. , the probe is ident to the array target ) , and the remain signal repres heterolog probe-and-target combin ( i.e. , the target dna came from a strain differ from that test in thi experi ) . tabl 4 . fabric of eight-by-eight influenza viru cdna array viru gene row dna spot at each column posit for : influenza A viru influenza B viru 1 and 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 7 and 8 HA 1 ha1-1 ha1-3 ha2-1 ha-1 2 ha2-2 ha2-3 ha2-4 ha-2 3 ha3-1 ha3-2 ha3-3 ha-3 NA 4 na1-1 na1-2 na1-3 na-1 5 na2-1 na2-2 na2-3 na-2 6 buffer buffer buffer na-3 MP 7 mp-1 mp-1 buffer mp-1 8 mp-2 mp-2 buffer E. coli tabl 5 . multiplex pcr primer combin and expect pcr product influenza viru target ( viru type/ subtyp ) pcr product gener by each primer mixtur : A ( a/ha1-1 , a/ha2-3 , a/ha3-3 , b/mp-1 ) B ( a/na1-1 , a/na2-2 , b/na-1 ) C ( a/mp-1 , b/ha-1 ) a/h1n1a a/ha1-1b a/na1-1b a/mp-1b a/h1n2 a/ha1-1 a/na2-2 a/mp-1 a/h2n1 a/ha2-3 a/na1-1 a/mp-1 a/h2n2a a/ha2-3b a/na2-2b a/mp-1b a/h3n1 a/ha3-3 a/na1-1 a/mp-1 a/h3n2a a/ha3-3b a/na2-2b a/mp-1b Ba b/mp-1b b/na-1b b/ha-1b a viru type and subtyp in thi studi . b see fig . 4 for analysi of multiplex pcr product . 702 LI ET AL . J. clin . microbiol . differ littl from the more-tradit method use with other nucleic acid bind membran , and thu experi with tradit method is directli applic to the glass array use in these studi . the prepar of dna array use now fairli standard technolog . We fix dna to the slide surfac use a 5- amine-tag oligonucleotid and carbodiimid cross-link . thi method seem to provid a more stabl array and work well if , as wa done here , clone insert can be reamplifi use a singl pair of primer direct against flank vector sequenc . howev , the high cost of amine-link primer render the method impract if mani differ modifi primer are desir . In such situat we have employ non- coval bind method with compar success ( J. Li and D. H. evan , unpublish data ) . To prepar dna array ca- pabl of type and subtyp human influenza A and B viru strain , we design 52 primer theoret capabl of ampli- fy 26 differ portion of the influenza A and B viru HA , NA , and MP gene ( tabl 3 ) . these primer amplifi all but two of the intend target in standard rt-pcr . one of the two failur ( b/mp-2 ) requir primer that bind to sequenc poorli repres in the databas and thu may have been badli design ; the failur of the other primer set ( a/ha1-2 ) is inexplic . the 24 success amplifi viral cdna nev- ertheless provid a suffici redund probe set for our purpos and were clone , sequenc , and array . these array dna , each about 500 bp long , were readili hybrid to probe prepar use the same cdna templat ( fig . 1 and 2 ) , with signal-to-background ratio rang from 6 to 30 ( fig . 2 ) . No obviou hybrid wa detect at non- homolog target , and no cross-hybrid wa detect among the differ subtyp of the virus . there wa some expect cross-hybrid seen when probe encod se- quenc share by two or more target sequenc . further anal- ysi of thi phenomenon show that 100 bp of homolog wa requir to produc ani detect bind ( fig . 3 ) . thi effect wa almost certainli due to the stringent anneal condit we use to ensur maxim specif , with the hybrid temperatur set 15â°c higher than is recommend by the manufactur of the hybrid buffer ( roch ) for use in southern blot applic . thi featur is use , becaus it ensur that primer-deriv sequenc common to both pcr product and chip-bound target will not cross-hybrid if illegitim sequenc have accident misamplifi . We also note that sensit wa improv by increas the size of the target spot and by increas the length of the fluoresc probe ( fig . 1 , panel 7 ) . thi last experi also illustr an import advantag of array partial redund gene frag- ment rather than veri larg singl cdna . the fact that a 1.6-kbp probe hybrid to three separ ha3 gene frag- ment show that the cdna encod sequenc span the entir gene . thi provid an addit check on the ident of the probe . It wa not obviou how sequenc mismatch affect hy- bridiz effici . use perfectli match probe ( i.e. , probe deriv from the same cdna clone as target dna ) we note signal-to-nois ratio vari from 6 to 30 over a varieti of gene fragment ( fig . 2 ) . A similar rang of signal- to-nois ratio ( 5 to 24 ) wa note when heterolog probe were prepar from viral isol belong onli to the same viral type and subtyp as the target viru cdna ( fig . 5 ) . analyz the caus of thi variat is difficult becaus it is hard to measur the specif activ of fluoresc probe and becaus there also appear to be target-specif variat in hybrid effici even with ident probe-target pair ( fig . 2 ) . howev , it is encourag to note that both target a/ha1-1 and a/na-1 ( deriv from a/new jersey/8/ 76 ) hybrid to probe deriv from viru strain a/denver/ 1/57 with signal-to-background ratio of 5.5 and 5.8 , respec- tive . upon the conclus of these experi we directli sequenc portion of these a/denver/1/57-deriv probe and found that the sequenc portion had 86 % sequenc ident with the target dna ( genbank access no . af305216 and af305218 ) . similarli , b/ha-1 and b/na-1 probe ( deriv from strain b/hong kong/5/72 ) hybrid to target deriv from strain b/maryland/1/59 with signal-to- background ratio of 19 and 24 , respect . In thi case se- quenc detect 96 % sequenc ident between probe and target ( genbank access no . af305219 and af305220 ) , suggest that mismatch may reduc the amount of probe bound under these stringent hybrid condit . never- theless , it seem clear that , if pcr primer of suffici broad util can be design , the great variat in influenza viru gene sequenc ( tabl 2 ) will not serious interfer with the applic of thi technolog . We are current expand the content of these array to permit detect of a much greater select of viral and other pathogen . acknowledg We thank A. holli and B. cooney for dna sequenc . thi work wa support by an omafra special research grant , the ontario innov trust , and the canadian foundat for in- novat . research in d.e .
