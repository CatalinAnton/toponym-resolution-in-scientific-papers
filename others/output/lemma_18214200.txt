In addit to trans- mission to domest poultri , hpai ( h5n1 ) â­infect mute swan have been implic in direct transmiss to human in azerbaijan ( 6 ) . the US naval medic research unit No . 3 and the ministri of envi- ronment of egypt have collabor sinc 2003 in obtain sampl from migratori bird to detect circul influenza virus . dure the 2005â­06 migratori bird season , 1,304 migra- tori bird were sampl from either live bird market or cage bird trap by fishermen in port said , damietta , fayoum , arish , and sharm el sheikh ( onlin appendix figur , panel A , avail from www.cdc.gov/eid/ content/13/7/1120-appg.htm ) . A total of 203 cloacal swab sam- ple were posit for influenzaaviru matrix gene when test by real-tim pcr , and 2 were also posit for the hemagglutinin 5 ( H5 ) gene by use specif primer ( 7 ) . Of the 2 migra- tori bird posit for the H5 gene , the first wa a common teal ( ana crec- ca ) captur in the nile delta region of damietta in octob 2005 ( onlin appendix figur , panel A ) . sequenc- ing of the H5 gene show that thi viru wa an lpai most close re- late to strain a/mallard/bavaria/1/ 2005 ( h5n2 ) ( genbank access no . dq387854 ( 2 ) . In januari 2006 , an influenza A H5 viru ( weak posit result ) wa detect in anoth common teal ( trap in a cage by a fisherman ) sampl from the damietta region in decemb 2005 ( onlin appendix figur , panel A ) . the low viral load , coupl with the failur to isol the viru , preclud the laboratori from conduct sequenc analysi at the time on the basi of insuffici tem- plate materi . after the outbreak of influenza A ( h5n1 ) in poultri and human in egypt in februari 2006 , addit retrospect attempt to concentr rna were use to as- sess potenti introduct scenario . after multipl rna extract were conduct and the rna wa concen- trate , thi specimen wa found to be posit for the neuraminidas 1 ( N1 ) gene by real-tim pcr . the hemagglutinin gene from both teal strain wa sequenc ( 1,596 bp ) . sequenc were align with other influenza A ( h5n1 ) strain from egypt ( 9 from human , 5 from chicken ) . twenti other strain with high similar and from differ lo- cation were select by use a gen- bank search algorithm and includ in the alignment.aphylogenet analysi wa conduct by use the kimura 2-paramet model . the lpai H5 vi- ru strain wa use as an outgroup in a neighbor-join phylogenet tree . bootstrap analysi with 500 replic of sequenc data wa also conduct by use mega 3.1 softwar ( 8 ) . phylogenet analysi show cluster of the hpai ( h5n1 ) strain collect from 1 geograph region ( countri ) ( onlin appendix figur , panel B ) . all hpai ( h5n1 ) strain from egypt from human or chicken analyz cluster with a bootstrap supportvalueof98 % .furthermor , the a/teal/egypt/14051-namru3/2006 letter emerg infecti diseas Â· www.cdc.gov/eid Â· vol . 13 , No . 7 , juli 2007 1121 ( h5n1 ) strain ( collect in decemb 2005 ; onlin appendix figur , panel A ) is an hpai and is close relat to the parent of the group of virus isol in the earli 2006 egypt out- break , with an averag ident of 99.4 % with all other strain from egypt and a bootstrap support valu of 96 % ( onlin appendix figur , panel B ) . despit the rapid spread of thi clade ( qinghai-lik strain ) to mani countri , sinc late 2005 , strain ana- lyze in thi studi show low-level genet variat ( < 2 % ) . brown et al . report that spe- cie can vari greatli in their respons to hpai ( 9 ) . At least in duck , it ap- pear that viral shed is highest in bird with clinic sign of infect , and lowest , as seen in the common teal infect with the hpai strain in thi studi , in bird with subclin in- fection . these subclin infect may be due to flock immun from previou exposur to lpai H5 viru or genet factor . thi suggest is conceiv in light of the lpai H5 viru detect in the other teal a few month earlier . such natur resist wild bird might serv as vector for introduct of hpai virus into new locat . data present herein suggest that an hpai viru may have been introduc into egypt through a migratori bird . whether poultri were infect befor mid-februari or the teal wa infect with influenza A ( h5n1 ) viru by a domest speci is not unknown . the low degre of viral shed in- dicat that detect of ani influenza A ( h5n1 ) viru in wild bird in a new region should be immedi fol- low up with effort to character the viru to control the spread of new subtypes/strain of hpai into new lo- cation . acknowledg We thank the egyptian ministri of environ for it continu collabora- tive effort in migratori bird surveil . thi studi wa support by the depart of defens global emerg- ing infect system ( work unit no . 847705.82000.25gb.e0018 ) . magdi D. saad , * lu'ay S. ahm , moham A. gamal-eldein , moham K. fouda , fouda M. khalil , samuel L. yingst , * michael A. parker , * and marshal R. montevillel* *u naval medic research unit No . 3 , cairo , egypt ; and ministri of environ , cairo , egypt refer 1 . alexand DJ .
