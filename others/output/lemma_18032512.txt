A single-amino-acid substitut in the ns1 protein chang the pathogen of h5n1 avian influenza virus in mice peirong jiao,1 guobin tian,1 yanb li,1 guohua deng,1 yongp jiang,1 chang liu,1 weilong liu,1 zhigao bu,1 yoshihiro kawaoka,2,3,4 and hualan chen1 * anim influenza laboratori of the ministri of agricultur and nation key laboratori of veterinari biotechnolog , harbin veterinari research institut , chines academi of agricultur scienc , 427 maduan street , harbin 150001 , peopl 's republ of china1 ; divis of virolog , depart of microbiolog and immunology,2 and intern research center for infecti diseas , institut of medic science,3 univers of tokyo , tokyo 108-8639 , japan ; and depart of pathobiolog scienc , school of veterinari medicin , univers of wisconsin , madison , wisconsin 537064 receiv 6 august 2007/accept 6 novemb 2007 In thi studi , we explor the molecular basi determin the virul of h5n1 avian influenza virus in mammalian host by compar two virus , a/duck/guangxi/12/03 ( dk/12 ) and a/duck/guangxi/27/03 ( dk/ 27 ) , which are genet similar but differ in their pathogen in mice . To assess the genet basi for thi differ in virul , we use revers genet to gener a seri of reassort and mutant of these two virus . We found that a single-amino-acid substitut of serin for prolin at posit 42 ( p42 ) in the ns1 protein dramat increas the virul of the dk/12 viru in mice , wherea the substitut of prolin for serin at the same posit ( s42p ) complet attenu the dk/27 viru . We further demonstr that the amino acid s42 of ns1 is critic for the h5n1 influenza viru to antagon host cell interferon induct and for the ns1 protein to prevent the double-strand rna-medi activ of the nf-b pathway and the irf-3 pathway . our result indic that the ns1 protein is critic for the pathogen of h5n1 influenza virus in mammalian host and that the amino acid s42 of ns1 play a key role in undermin the antivir immun respons of the host cell . h5n1 highli pathogen avian influenza viru ( hpaiv ) is not onli a catastroph pathogen for poultri , but it pose a sever threat to the public health and may caus a futur influenza pandem . In 1997 , highli pathogen h5n1 avian influenza viru caus outbreak in chicken in hong kong and wa transmit to human , caus the death of 6 of 18 peopl infect ( 4 , 31 ) . the h5n1 outbreak in poultri , which becam widespread in late 2003 , affect at least 10 asian countri initi , but sinc then , h5n1 virus have been isol from wild bird ( 3 ) and poultri in multipl countri in asia , europ , and africa ( http : //www.oie.int ) . h5n1 influenza viru infect have occur in sever mammalian speci , such as pig , domest cat , tiger , and leopard ( http : //www .oie.int ) . more importantli , human case of h5n1 infect have been report in mani countri ( http : //www.who.int ) , with greater than 50 % mortal caus by h5n1 virus among infect human . such find have spark great in- terest in pandem prepared as well as in understand the genet determin of influenza viru pathogen and the abil of the viru to cross speci barrier to mammalian host . the pathogen of influenza virus is determin by mani factor , includ virus-specif determin encod within the viru genom . In the H5 and H7 subtyp of influenza virus , the multipl basic amino acid adjac to the cleavag site of the hemagglutinin ( HA ) glycoprotein are a prerequisit for lethal in chicken and mice ( 12 , 13 , 30 ) . for h5n1 influenza virus , a revers genet studi demonstr that a single-amino-acid sub- stitut at posit 627 of the pb2 protein from glutam acid to lysin is respons for virul in mammalian speci ( 12 ) . moreov , the amino acid at posit 701 in pb2 play a crucial role in the abil of h5n1 virus of duck origin to replic and be lethal in mice ( 16 ) . thi same pb2 amino acid residu con- tribut to the increas lethal of an h7n1 avian influenza viru in a mous model ( 9 ) . sever studi have report that the ns1 protein is also associ with the virul and host rang of influenza vi- ruse in differ anim model ( 17 , 23 , 27 , 28 ) . influenza virus in which the ns1 gene wa delet exhibit an atten- uat phenotyp in mice and pig ( 23 , 28 ) . the glutam acid at posit 92 of the ns1 protein of the h5n1 influenza viru that transmit to human in 1997 wa shown to be critic in confer virul and resist to antivir cytokin in pig ( 27 ) . howev , h5n1 viru with thi amino acid residu is no longer circul in natur and glutam acid is not found in the ns1 protein of other influenza virus . anoth amino acid substitut at posit 149 of the ns1 protein from valin to alanin wa shown to be respons for the replic of a goos h5n1 influenza viru in chicken ( 17 ) ; howev , thi mutat did not affect viru virul in mammal ( H. chen , unpublish data ) . thu , the specif amino acid residu in avian ns1 that are respons for confer high virul in mammal remain unclear . host factor , such as the immun respons , also play a role in determin influenza viru pathogen ( 14 ) . the inter- * correspond author . mail address : harbin veterinari research institut , caa , 427 maduan street , harbin 150001 , peopl 's republ of china . phone : 86-451-85935079 . fax : 86-451-82733132 . e-mail : hlchen1 @ yahoo.com . publish ahead of print on 21 novemb 2007 . 1146 feron ( ifn ) respons repres an earli host defens mech- anism against viral infect and is an import compon of innat immun ( 33 ) . the presenc of double-strand rna ( dsrna ) is a signal to the host cell that viru infect and replic are occur and trigger a plethora of anti- viral host defens mechan ( 5 , 29 ) . the presenc of dsrna induc the synthesi of alpha/beta ifn ( ifn-/ ) protein through the activ of sever transcript factor , includ- ing irf-3 , irf-7 , nf-b , and c-jun/atf2 . influenza virus have dsrna speci of replic intermedi that elicit the host ifn respons . the secret ifn-/ induc an antivir state in influenza virus-infect and uninfect neighbor cell by stimul the transcript of ifn-stimul re- spons element promoter-contain gene via the jak/stat pathway ( 29 ) . howev , influenza and other virus have de- velop strategi to counteract host ifn-/ product , through inhibit the activ of transcript factor in- volv in ifn activ ( 10 , 18 ) and by attenu host gene express ( 20 ) . antagon of the innat respons by influ- enza viru is a properti of the ns1 protein ( 7 , 11 , 20 ) . al- though data in thi area of research are grow , there remain facet of host rang and virul determin that need further examin . In thi studi , we character two h5n1 avian influenza virus that were isol from duck , a/duck/guangxi/12/ 2003 ( dk/12 ) and a/duck/guangxi/27/2003 ( dk/27 ) , in the guangxi provinc of china in 2003 . these two virus are highli pathogen for chicken but differ in their virul in mice . We use revers genet to determin the molecular basi for the differ in virul in mice and to explor the possibl underli mechan .

We isol two h5n1 virus , dk/12 and dk/27 , from appar healthi duck in the guangxi provinc of china in 2003 dure routin surveil . the pathogen analysi of these two virus in chicken ( follow the recommend by the offic intern de epizooti [ 21 ] ) reveal that the dk/27 viru kill all 10 chicken within 24 h and yield an ivpi of 3 ( with 3.0 be the most pathogen and 0 be the least pathogen ) . al- though the dk/12 viru wa milder than the dk/27 viru , it kill 7 of 10 chicken within 10 day , and it ivpi valu wa 1.4 . therefor , both of the virus were highli pathogen for chicken . We then test the virul of these two virus in a mam- malian mous model describ previous ( 2 ) . three mice from each group were kill on day 4 and day 6 after intranas inocul of 106 eid50 of viru , and their organ were col- lect for viru titrat in egg . the dk/12 viru replic in the mous lung without adapt , and the mean titer reach 3.9 log eid50 on day 4 p.i . ; howev , the viru wa not detect in ani other organ test ( fig . 1A ) . dk/12 viru caus 5 % bodi weight loss by day 9 p.i . at which point the mice start to regain the weight over the cours of the re- main observ period ( data not shown ) . In contrast , dk/27 caus a system infect , replic to the high titer of 7.3 log eid50 in the lung and to the titer of 3.6 , 2.9 , and 2.2 log eid50 in the spleen , kidney , and brain , respect ( fig . 1A ; tabl 2 ) . infect with dk/27 viru caus a more than 30 % reduct in bodi weight , and all of the mice die befor day 8 p.i . the two h5n1 virus markedli differ in the dose fig . 1 . replic and lethal of the dk/12 and dk/27 virus in mice .

To determin the genet relationship between the two virus , we sequenc their genom and compar them with the avail- abl sequenc of h5n1 virus . We found that the two virus are close relat , with all of their eight segment share over 99 % homolog with the previous report a/duck/fujian/01/02 viru ( 2 ) . dk/12 and dk/27 share the same pb1 , NP , M1 , M2 , and ns2 gene at the amino acid level . At the amino acid level , we map a total of eight differ between the two virus in their pb2 , PA , HA , NP , and ns1 gene ( tabl 3 ) . these data suggest that single- or multiple-amino-acid combin among these eight differ amino acid contribut to the differ in virul in mice of the two virus . rescu dk/12 and dk/27 virus maintain the biologi- cal properti of the wild-typ virus . To investig the ge- netic basi of the virul of the dk/12 and dk/27 virus , we establish a revers genet system for the two virus . We insert cdna of each full-length rna segment of dk/12 and dk/27 into the viral rna-mrna bidirect express plasmid pbd , as describ in materi and method . use these plasmid , we gener the dk/12 and dk/27 virus from clone cdna , design r-dk/12 and r-dk/27 , respect . after confirm by sequenc analysi , we prepar viru stock by use of 10-day-old specific-pathogen-fre ( spf ) egg and test the replic and lethal of these virus in mice . r-dk/12 and r-dk/27 exhibit properti similar to those of their re- spectiv origin virus in term of viru titer in organ and with respect to mld50 ( fig . 1D and E ; tabl 2 ) . the NS gene play a major role in the differ in patho- genic in mice between the dk/12 and dk/27 virus . To identifi the gene respons for the differ in pathogenic- iti between the dk/12 and dk/27 virus , we gener five single-gen recombin virus , each bear the pb2 , PA , HA , NP , or NS gene from dk/27 and the other seven gene from dk/12 . the recombin virus that contain the pb2 , PA , HA , or NP gene of dk/27 ( design dk/12-27pb2 , dk/12-27pa , dk/12-27ha , or dk/12-27np , respect ) dis- play the same low pathogen in mice as the wild-typ dk/12 viru ( mld50 , 6.4 log eid50 ) and replic onli in the lung ( tabl 2 ) , although the viru titer in the lung of mice infect with dk/12-27pa or dk/12-27np viru were signifi- cantli higher than that of the dk/12 virus-infect mice . dk/ 12-27pa also caus about 20 % weight loss in inocul mice , wherea dk/12-27pb2 , dk/12-27ha , and dk/12-27np vi- ruse caus onli a transient reduct in bodi weight ( fig . tabl 2 . replic of transfect virus in micea viru mean viru titer ( log10 eid50/ml SD ) at indic day p.i . in : mld50 ( log eid50 ) lung spleen kidney brain day 4 p.i . day 6 p.i . day 4 p.i . day 6 p.i . day 4 p.i . day 6 p.i . day 4 p.i . day 6 p.i . dk/12 3.9 0.5 3.6 0.7 6.4 dk/27 7.3 0.1 6.9 0.4 3.6 0.3 2.0 0.9 2.9 0.9 3.0 0.1 2.2 0.8 3.1 0.1 0.6 r-dk/12 3.5 0.1 3.5 0.6 6.4 r-dk/27 7.2 0.3 6.9 0.4 3.8 0.3 1.8 0.6 2.7 0.7 2.9 0.1 2.0 0.5 2.8 0.3 0.6 dk/12-27pb2 4.5 0.5 4.5 0.7 6.4 dk/12-27pa 5.9 0.4c 4.1 1.0 6.4 dk/12-27ha 3.8 0.3 4.5 0.4 6.4 dk/12-27np 5.1 0.3c 5.5 0.5b 6.4 dk/12-27n 5.8 0.6c 6.9 0.4c 2.3 0.1 2.6 0.3 1.6 0.3 1.6 0.5 3.1 0.3 2.0 dk/27-12pb2 5.6 0.5e 5.9 0.5 2.2 0.8e 2.8 0.4 2.0 0.5 2.9 0.5 1.5 0.1 2.9 0.5 0.6 dk/27-12pa 5.7 0.4e 6.4 0.1 2.1 0.6d 2.3 0.8 1.3 0.1d 1.9 0.4d 1.9 0.7 2.5 0.4 1.5 dk/27-12ha 6.8 0.3 5.8 0.5d 3.5 0.7 3.0 0.5d 2.4 0.1 2.5 0.4 1.4 0.1 2.4 0.9 1.5 dk/27-12np 6.5 0.4 6.3 0.6 3.1 0.6 2.5 0.4 2.4 0.1 2.2 0.1 1.4 0.1 2.9 0.4 0.6 dk/27-12n 3.9 0.5e 4.9 0.5e 6.4 dk/12ns1p42 6.5 0.4c 6.8 0.3c 2.0 0.7 2.0 0.7 1.3 0.1 1.3 0.1 3.3 0.8 2.2 dk/12ns1n48 3.4 0.1 4.5 0.4 6.4 dk/27ns1s42p 4.5 0.4e 5.8 0.3d 6.4 dk/27ns1s48n 7.3 0.1 7.5 0.1 2.5 1.1 2.8 0.8 1.7 0.7 3.1 0.8 2.2 0.9 3.1 0.3 0.8 dk/27ns1r38a 7.6 0.3 7.3 0.8 2.1 0.8 1.4 0.1 2.1 0.6 2.1 0.6 1.4 0.1 2.4 0.1 0.8 dk/27ns1k41a 6.6 0.3 6.5 0.4 1.7 0.4 1.4 0.1 1.6 0.3 2.2 0.3 1.6 0.5 2.9 0.4 0.6 dk/27ns1r38ak41a 5.0 0.5d 4.6 0.7e 6.4 a six-week-old spf balb/c mice were inocul intranas with 106 eid50 of each viru in a 50-l volum . three mice from each group were kill on day 4 and 6 p.i. , and viru titer were determin in sampl of lung , spleen , kidney , and brain in egg . , no viru wa isol from the sampl . b P valu wa 0.05 compar with the titer in the correspond organ of the dk/12- or r-dk/12-inocul mice . c P valu wa 0.01 compar with the titer in the correspond organ of the dk/12- or r-dk/12-inocul mice . d P valu wa 0.05 compar with the titer in the correspond organ of the dk/27- or r-dk/27-inocul mice . e P valu wa 0.01 compar with the titer in the correspond organ of the dk/27- or r-dk/27-inocul mice . tabl 3 . amino acid differ between the dk/12 and dk/27 virus gene segment posit of amino acid amino acid in : dk/12 viru dk/27 viru pb2 497 ser ( S ) asn ( N ) 607 leu ( L ) val ( V ) 612 ala ( A ) thr ( T ) PA 44 glu ( G ) val ( V ) HA 216 val ( V ) ile ( I ) NP 105 met ( M ) val ( V ) ns1 42 pro ( P ) ser ( S ) 48 asn ( N ) ser ( S ) vol . 82 , 2008 pathogen OF h5n1 avian influenza virus 1149 2A ) .

In addit , dk/27-12n caus a reduct in the bodi weight of the mice over the first 10 day after infect , but the mice regain weight over the remain observ period ( fig . 2B ) . these result indic that the NS gene play a major role in the differ in pathogen in mice between the dk/12 and dk/27 virus . amino acid substitut at posit 42 in the ns1 protein chang the pathogen of the dk/12 and dk/27 virus in mice . there are onli two amino acid differ in the NS gene between dk/12 and dk/27 , and both of the chang are locat in the ns1 protein ; that is , at posit 42 and 48 ( tabl 3 ) . To elucid the molecular basi of the virul and replic discrep between the dk/12 and dk/27 virus , we gener- ate four mutant virus each contain a substitut of the ns1 amino acid residu at posit 42 or 48 and test their pathogen in mice . A mutant dk/12 viru , design dk/12ns1p42 and contain a substitut at amino acid posit 42 that reflect the sequenc found in the dk/27 ns1 protein ( a pro-to-s substitut ) , wa highli pathogen in mice , in contrast to the dk/12 viru ( mld50 , 2.2 versu 6.4 log eid50 ) . thi mutant caus system infect in anim ( fig . 3 ; tabl 2 ) . A mutant dk/12 viru encod an asn-to- ser mutat at posit 48 of ns1 ( dk/12ns1n48 ) wa not lethal and replic onli in the lung of mice ( mld50 , 6.4 log eid50 ) ( fig . 3 ; tabl 2 ) . similarli , a ser-to-pro substitut at posit 42 in the ns1 protein of dk/27 that reflect the sequenc found in the dk/12 viru result in mark atten- uation of the dk/27 viru ( mld50 , 0.6 versu 6.4 log eid50 ) . thi mutant , dk/27ns1s42p , replic onli in the lung and caus a transient reduct in the bodi weight of the mice ( tabl 2 ; fig . 3 ) . howev , the mutant viru dk/27ns1s48n , contain a ser-to-asn mutat introduc at posit 48 of the ns1 protein , wa not attenu with respect to the dk/27 viru . these result suggest that the amino acid at posit 42 of ns1 protein is critic for the differ in virul be- tween the dk/12 and dk/27 virus in mice . the genom of the virus recov on day 4 and 6 p.i . from the lung of mice infect with the NS reassort or mutant virus were sequenc .

We further investig the express and secret of the ifn-/ for a549 cell infect by differ virus . the cultur supernat were harvest 24 h after infect , and the amount of ifn- and ifn- were measur by elisa . the result confirm that infect with wild-typ dk/12 or mutant dk/27ns1s42p vi- ru induc higher level of ifn-/ express and secret than infect with wild-typ dk/27 or mutant dk/12ns1p42 viru ( fig . 4C ) . sinc previou report indic that the abil of the influ- enza viru to antagon ifn-/ induct by the host wa relat to ns1 protein express level in the infect cell ( 17 , 28 ) , we compar the level of NS protein express in virus-infect cell by western blot ( fig . 4D ) . No signifi- cant differ in the level of viral protein , includ ns1 and NP , wa detect among the sampl . the amino acid at posit 42 is critic for the ns1 protein to inhibit dsrna-medi nf-b-respons promot acti- vation . activ of nf-b and irf-3 is requir for the induct of the ifn- promot ( 6 , 25 , 26 , 32 , 36 ) . nf-b ha been shown to bind to the posit regulatori domain II of the ifn- promot and to play an essenti role in regul ifn- transcript ( 1 , 8 ) . express of the ns1 protein of influenza A viru is known to prevent virus- and/or dsrna- mediat activ of the nf-b pathway ( 35 ) . To determin whether the contribut of the ns1 protein to the pathoge- niciti of the dk/12 and dk/27 virus is associ with block the activ of the nf-b pathway , we use an nf-b report gene , pnf-b-luc , which contain a lucifer- ase report gene under the control of an nf-b-respons promot . cotransfect of pnf-b-luc with express plas- mid p12ns1 or p27ns1s42p did not inhibit the express of dsrna [ poli ( I : C ) ] -induc report gene activ in 293t cell , wherea cotransfect of p27ns1 or p12ns1p42 sub- stantial reduc it ( fig . 5A ) . these result demonstr that the ns1 protein of dk/12 and dk/27 virus differ in their abil to prevent the dsrna-medi activ of the nf-b pathway , and the amino acid at posit 42 in ns1 is critic for thi function . the differ in report gene in- duction wa not due to differ in ns1 protein level , as western blot demonstr that wild-typ and mutant ns1 protein were express in 293t cell at similar level ( data not shown ) . the amino acid at posit 42 is critic for the ns1 protein to inhibit dsrna-medi irf-3-depend promot activa- tion . ns1 protein of influenza A viru ha been report to inhibit the activ of irf-3 , which is a key regul of ifn gene express ( 32 ) . the isg54 promot is one of the pro- moter that can be directli activ by the irf-3 , and it could also be activ by ifn produc in respons to dsrna treatment or to viral infect . To investig if the amino acid chang in 42 affect the abil of ns1 protein to inhibit the activ of the irf-3-depend promot , we transfect the vero cell , which do not produc ifn-/ , with a isg54- luc report plasmid plu a constitut express renilla luciferas plasmid and a mammalian express plasmid . the express plasmid wa empti vector pcagg or the pcagg plasmid express the wild-typ or mutant ns1 gene . cotransfect of pisg54-luc with the plasmid p12ns1 or p27ns1s42p did not inhibit the express of dsrna [ poli ( I : C ) ] -induc report gene activ in vero cell , wherea cotransfect of p27ns1 or p12ns1p42 substan- tialli reduc it ( fig . 5B ) . these result demonstr that the ns1 protein of dk/12 and dk/27 virus differ in their abil- iti to inhibit the dsrna-medi activ of the irf-3- depend promot , and the amino acid at posit 42 in ns1 is critic for thi function . western blot demonstr that fig . 5 . prevent of poli ( I : C ) -induc activ of an nf-b promot and the irf-3-deped promot by ns1 protein .

J. virol . wild-typ and mutant ns1 protein were express in vero cell at similar level ( data not shown ) . At least one of the two basic amino acid at posit r38 or k41 in the ns1 protein is requir for the virul of the dk/27 viru in mice . amino acid r38 and k41 in the rna- bind domain of the ns1 protein have previous been shown to be import in the inhibit of ifn product and the virul of the influenza virus ( 6 , 19 ) . both of our h5n1 avian influenza virus contain r38 and k41 in the ns1 pro- tein . To investig whether these two basic amino acid con- tribut to virul , we gener three ns1 mutant virus in the dk/27 background , dk/27r38a , dk/27k41a , and dk/ 27r38ak41a , and test their replic and virul in mice . As shown in tabl 2 and fig . 3 , the mutant with a single-amino-acid substitut , dk/27r38a and dk/27k41a , replic system and were highli virul in mice , with mld50 of 0.8 and 0.6 log eid50 , respect . howev , the doubl mutant dk/27r38ak41a replic onli in the lung and wa highli attenu in thi anim ( mld50 , 6.4 log eid50 ) ( fig . 3 ; tabl 2 ) . dk/27r38ak41a still ha ser at posit 42 of ns1 . these result demonstr that the amino acid s42 and at least one of the basic amino acid at posit r38 or k41 in ns1 are requir for the virul of dk/27 in mice . discuss h5n1 avian influenza virus have caus the death of more than half of the human they have infect sinc 1997 and clearli repres a threat to public health . although dif- ferent strain of h5n1 viru are known to have substanti differ pathotyp , the effect of specif amino acid chang on the host rang and virul of h5n1 hpaiv remain larg unexplor . here , we character two h5n1 hpaiv , dk/12 and dk/27 , which have similar genom but show markedli differ pathogen in mice . use thi pair of virus and single-gen reassort virus creat from them , we demonstr that the ns1 protein contribut to the dif- ferent pathogen of these two virus in mice and that the amino acid residu at posit 42 in the ns1 protein of dk/27 is import for it abil to replic and caus lethal in mice and to antagon ifn-/ product in a549 cell . We further demonstr that the amino acid at posit 42 of ns1 is critic for the abil of these virus to inhibit dsrna- mediat activ of the nf-b pathway and the irf-3 pathway . thi is the first demonstr that a singl amino acid at posit 42 of the ns1 gene play a major role in the determin of virul of h5n1 avian influenza viru in a mammalian host . mutat or delet within the effector domain of the ns1 gene have previous been shown to affect the abil of influ- enza virus to antagon ifn-/ product , and the de- creas abil of the viru to antagon ifn-/ product is link with reduc express level of the ns1 protein in infect cell ( 17 , 28 ) . In thi studi , the mutat of amino acid 42 within the rna-bind domain of ns1 affect the abil of the viru to antagon ifn-/ product in a549 cell , suggest that the rna-bind domain also contribut to the abil of the ns1 protein to antagon ifn-/ produc- tion in host cell . howev , ns1 protein level were not sig- nificantli differ among the four virus test ( fig . 4D ) , suggest that the mechan by which the ns1 effector domain and the ns1 rna-bind domain antagon host ifn-/ product are differ . In addit , the mutat of amino acid 42 within the rna-bind domain of ns1 block the viru from prevent the dsrna-medi activ of the nf-b pathway and the irf-3-depend promot , dem- onstrat the import of the abil of ns1 to counteract the host cell antivir immun respons . the amino acid at posit 42 of ns1 vari among avian influenza virus ; howev , the serin at thi posit is highli conserv in the human , swine , and equin influenza virus ( 2,561 of 2,564 influenza virus isol from mammalian host have s42 in their ns1 gene ) . base on the avail sequenc inform , all 135 h5n1 influenza virus that have been isol from human and other mammal have serin at posit 42 in the ns1 protein . the amino acid at posit 42 is locat within the second -helix span amino acid 30 to 50 of the rna-bind domain of ns1 protein ( 34 ) . two basic amino acid , r38 and k41 , in thi same region have previous been report to be import for inhibit host ifn induc- tion and virul of influenza A virus ( 6 ) . use wsn viru , donelan et al . demonstr that the basic amino acid arginin at posit 38 and lysin at posit 41 of ns1 play a critic role in the inhibit of ifn product and in the virul of the viru in mice , and an attenu mutant contain ns1 , r38ak41a , acquir increas virul in mice as a result of the mutat of ns1 s42g ( 6 ) . A recent studi ( 19 ) report that a mutant viru design a/udorn/72 and contain alanin instead of asparagin at posit 38 wa highli atten- uat in mdck cell . our data indic that dk/27 virus contain the singl substitut of alanin for either of the basic amino acid at posit 38 and 41 alon were not atten- uat in mice , but substitut of alanin at both posit led to complet attenu . togeth with our find of the import of the amino acid at posit 42 in virul , these data emphas the critic role of the second -helix structur of the rna-bind domain of ns1 for ifn antagon and for virul . A recent studi report that the rna helicas enzym retino acid-induc gene I ( rig-i ) act as a single-strand rna sensor and a potenti target of viral immun evas , and ns1 protein of influenza A viru block the rig-i activa- tion mediat by viral genom single-strand rna bear 5 phosphat ( 22 ) . It remain to be investig if the contri- bution of the ns1 protein to the pathogen of the dk/12 and dk/27 virus is associ with block the activ of rig-i induc by the viral genom 5-phosphoryl rna . In summari , we demonstr here that the amino acid at posit 42 of ns1 play an import role in the abil of h5n1 influenza virus to antagon the host ifn respons and for the virul of h5n1 avian influenza viru in a mam- malian host . We also attest that the rna-bind domain of the ns1 protein play an import role in prevent the dsrna-medi activ of the nk-b pathway and the irf-3 pathway . our result provid strong addit evid that the ns1 protein is a virul factor for h5n1 avian influenza virus and that multipl domain within thi protein may be suitabl target for the develop of antivir drug and attenu vaccin . vol . 82 , 2008 pathogen OF h5n1 avian influenza virus 1153 acknowledg We thank gloria kelli and susan watson for edit the manu- script , michael whitt for provid the revers genet system for gener the recombin vsv-gfp , and nanci cox and kanta subbarao for provid the plasmid pbd . thi work wa support by chines nation S & T plan grant 2004ba519a-57 , the chines nation key basic research program ( 973 ) 2005cb523005 and 2005cb523200 ; by grants-in-aid and a con- tract research fund from the ministri of educ , cultur , sport , scienc and technolog , japan , program of found research center for emerg and reemerg infecti diseas ; and by nation institut of allergi and infecti diseas public health servic research grant . refer 1 . algart ┬┤ , M. , H. nguyen , C. heylbroeck , R. lin , and J. hiscott . 1999 . ib- mediat inhibit of virus-induc beta interferon transcript .
