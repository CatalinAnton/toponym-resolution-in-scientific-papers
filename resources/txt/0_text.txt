Susan dropped the plate. It shattered loudly.

The music stopped, and that upset everyone.

Tom and Jane are good friends.
They are cool.
He knows a lot of things and so does she.
His car is red, but hers is blue. 
It is older than hers. The big cat ate its dinner.

Because he was very cold, David put on his coat.

His friends have been criticizing Jim for exaggerating.

You and I are best friends since 2005.
We should go to California. It is a nice place.
That is a nice place.
We should go there sometime.
Los Angeles is the first city we should visit. I heard it is nice.
Then we should visit San Diego. It has many nice restaurants.
Those places have tasty food.
Then up we go to New York. You will like it there. It is known as the city that never sleeps.
