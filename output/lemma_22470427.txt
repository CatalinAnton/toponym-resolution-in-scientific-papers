In addit , new antigen variant can also emerg by reassort when influenza A virus with differ HA and NA subtyp co-infect the same anim ( antigen shift ) . thi process lead to the appear of new subtyp with dramat chang in antigen [ 5,7 ] . As a result of antigen shift or drift , influenza virus with novel combin of gene segment or point mutat have been isol from variou anim speci [ 1,5,8,9 ] . In april 2009 a novel h1n1 influenza viru reassort that contain gene from north american and eurasian influenza virus began infect peopl in mexico . thi new influenza viru quickli spread into the usa and canada and subsequ worldwid [ 10 ] . soon after the initi human report , thi pandem h1n1 ( ph1n1 ) viru wa isol from a swine herd in alberta , canada in may 2009 [ 9,11 ] . the first report of ph1n1 viru infect of turkey came from chile in august 2009 [ 12 ] and later from ontario , canada in octob 2009 [ 13 ] . involv of these livestock speci further complic public health and veterinari regulatori respons due to the unknown role that pig , poultri and other domest anim might play in the evolut of thi viru . consequ , emerg of such novel virus with uniqu gene constel not onli pose a threat to human health , but might also have implic for anim health and intern trade . plo one | www.plosone.org 1 march 2012 | volum 7 | issu 3 | e32858 swine influenza virus have receiv increas attent in recent year from both the veterinari and public health author becaus of pig be view as potenti `` mix vessel '' for the gener of novel virus . In north america , the virus that have been respons for outbreak in swine sinc 1998 have chang dramat from the virus that were respons for outbreak in the previou 70 year [ 14 ] . prior to 1998 swine influenza wa almost exclus caus by virus of the classic swine h1n1 lineag ( ch1n1 ) which wa first identifi in north america in 1930 [ 15 ] . thi h1n1 viru is also relat to the 1918 spanish influenza viru . thi situat chang in 1998 when a sever outbreak of swine influenza occur in north carolina follow by addit outbreak in minnesota , iowa and texa [ 14,16 ] . the virus respons for the minnesota , iowa and texa outbreak were tripl reassort ( TR ) h3n2 virus which contain human ( HA , NA , pb1 ) , swine ( NS , NP , M ) and avian ( pb2 , PA ) influenza A viru gene [ 16,17 ] . By the end of 1999 these TR h3n2 virus were widespread in the US swine popul and were first report in canadian pig and turkey in 2005 [ 6 ] . approxim 45 % of the turkey product in canada is locat in ontario , often in area that are dens popul with both swine and turkey farm . sinc 2005 , drop in egg product in breeder turkey attribut to and coincid with the circul of TR h3n2 virus in adjac pig farm [ 6 ] ha plagu turkey produc in southern ontario . other have report similar reproduct problem in femal turkey in associ with TR h3n2 infect [ 18,19,20,21 ] . As wa previous suggest for the situat in the US [ 18 ] , the close proxim of swine and turkey farm appear to play a signific role in the epidemiolog of TR h3n2 influenza viru infect of turkey . In a previou studi [ 13 ] , we genet character pandem h1n1 2009 virus isol from breeder turkey that had an associ drop in egg product . In thi paper , we antigen and genet character three uniqu TR h3n2 influenza virus that were isol from three breeder turkey flock at differ geograph locat in southern ontario at differ time dure 2011 . materi and method clinic submiss thi studi involv a field outbreak of influenza A viru in turkey . the owner of the anim associ with thi studi have read and approv thi manuscript but wish to remain anonym . viru isol procedur involv embryon chicken egg were in complianc with canadian council for anim care guidelin . the chicken embryo were inocul at 9 day of gestat and fluid harvest 5 day afterward . all three diagnost submiss were compris of tracheal and cloacal swab . they origin from three geograph separ breeder turkey farm own by the same compani in southern ontario that had experienc signific drop in egg product . two of three flock were vaccin with an inactiv A/ mallard duck/mn/79/79 ( h3n4 ) oil emuls vaccin and had detect antibodi titer befor exposur to field viru . the origin sampl concern thi studi were collect by the compani veterinarian and submit to the provinci veterinari diagnost laboratori ( anim health laboratori , univers of guelph ) . diagnost test result along with the sampl were forward to the nation centr for foreign anim diseas ( ncfad ) as part of a feder mandat diseas surveil program . addit work wa carri out at the company' request to determin the reason for vaccin failur . the owner of the bird provid ncfad with the convalesc sera collect from sick turkey and the sera collect from h3n4 vaccin turkey prior to field viru as part of a follow up studi aim at determin the reason for vaccin failur . refer antisera to a/perth/16/2009 ( h3n2 ) produc in ferret wa carri out under anim use document h-07-13 `` prepar of refer antisera to variou strain of live human influenza viru in ferret '' approv by the canadian scienc centr for human & anim health anim care committe in complianc with canadian council for anim care guidelin . the remain antisera were prepar under anim use document c-08-002 `` product of antisera to avian influenza virus and avian paramyxovirus '' approv by the same anim care committe . the chicken red blood cell are obtain on a weekli basi from the canadian food inspect agenc 's ontario laboratori fallowfield specific-pathogen-fre flock under anim use docu- ment acc 11-03 `` blood collect from farm anim '' , that wa approv by the institut anim care committe in complianc with canadian council for anim care guidelin . the turkey red blood cell were purchas from lampir biolog laboratori , inc. p.o . box 270 pipersvil , PA , usa . 1st submiss ( fav-003 ) .

To our knowledg , thi is the first report of the isol of ph1n1/tr h3n2 reassort virus from a domest poultri speci . phylogenet analysi of the HA and NA gene from fav-009 and fav-0010 show that they are close relat to a/swine/ qc/126553/2010 ( h3n2 ) and a/swine/qc/1268883/2010 ( h3n2 ) which were isol from pig with respiratori ill in quebec . the latter h3n2 isol from swine also ha pandem h1n1 intern gene [ 28 ] , but of a differ assemblag than those found in fav-009 and fav-010 . the other TR h3n2 viru ( fav- 003 ) wa close relat to other TR h3n2 virus that were isol from pig in 2009 in quebec . although phylogenet analysi show that these virus were like introduc to turkey from pig , we were not abl to find ani epidemiolog link between the farm . In contrast to the chicken reproduct tract that contain onli a2- 3-link sialic acid receptor , turkey may contain both a2-3-link and a2-6-link sialic acid receptor in their reproduct tract which could be involv in the attach and replic of human and swine-lik influenza virus [ 19,20 ] . amino acid at posit 226 and 228 in the ha1 subunit of H3 subtyp influenza virus were shown to be necessari for the switch in receptor specif from a2- 3-link to a2-6-link sialic acid and adapt from avian to mammalian host [ 29 ] . all three turkey isol describ here had mutat in these 2 amino acid posit ( q226v and g228 ) that are associ with the chang from a2-3 to a2-6 specif . the drop in egg product in these turkey is most like associ with viru replic in their reproduct tract . despit the fact that pig are normal view as `` mix vessel '' for the gener of reassort influenza A virus , we can not exclud the possibl that the reassort between TR h3n2 and ph1n1 took place in turkey , even though sera from submiss fav-0010 gave neg HI result when use pandem h1n1 antigen ( data not shown ) . nevertheless , the result describ here should be of concern , consid the reassort capac of thi viru and the suscept of turkey to influenza virus of H1 to h16 subtyp . accord to nobusawa et al . [ 30 ] , a point mutat that result in a glu to asp substitut at amino acid posit 190 ( e190d ) in the HA protein of a/aichi/51/92 wa respons for the loss of the abil to bind to crbc . all three isol describ in thi studi were test for their abil to agglutin crbc and trbc . a/tk/ on/fav-003/2011 did not agglutin crbc , but could agglutin trbc . the other two isol had better hemagglu- tinat result with trbc than crbc . all 3 isol had amino acid chang at e190d , but the onli isol that did n't agglutin crbc wa from fav-003 . therefor , multipl amino acid chang involv the HA protein are like necessari to chang the receptor bind specif . nakajima et al . 2003 [ 31 ] suggest that the effect of hemadsorpt activ of an amino acid chang on the HA protein primarili depend on the posit rather than the speci of substitut amino acid . they show that mutat of the amino acid at posit 156 from lysin to glutam acid , asparagin , glutamin , or isoleucin wa shown to be associ with the loss of hemadsorpt activ . fav-003 ha asparagin at thi posit and thi might have had the neg effect on hemagglutin activ , but the other 2 isol with hemagglutin activ had histidin at thi posit . the hemagglutinin protein of H3 influenza virus ha accumul a number of glycosyl site dure it evolut over the past 40 year [ 32 ] . glycosyl appear to be one way by which a viru can mask it epitop and evad detect by the host 's immun system . In addit , some studi have associ increas glycosyl with reduc virul [ 32,33,34 ] . although the three turkey isol from thi studi share 6 potenti n-link glycosyl site at posit 22 , 38 , 63 , 126 , 165 and 285 with the close relat cluster IV virus of swine , they lack a potenti glycosyl site at posit 246 . In canada , the onli approv vaccin for turkey against h3n2 virus is the inactiv h3n4 vaccin made from a strain isol from a mallard duck in 1979 . although , two of the breeder turkey flock in thi studi were immun with thi vaccin , the field strain describ here were abl to infect the turkey and caus a loss in egg product . the fact that the sera collect from h3n4 vaccin turkey were not abl to neutral ani of the newli isol h3n2 virus describ in thi studi confirm the poor efficaci of thi vaccin . We believ the vaccin failur wa associ with amino acid substitut in the globular head domain of the ha1 subunit which contain the immunodomin antigen site . the percent amino acid ident of the ha1 between the h3n4 vaccin strain and fav-003 wa 79 % and with fav-009 or fav-0010 ┬н 80 % . previou studi have also shown that mutat in the 5 immunodomin antigen site locat on the globular head of the ha1 subunit play a key role in viru escap from host immun pressur as a result of accumul conform chang [ 18,30,35 ] . the amino acid substitut coupl with chang associ with the appear of oligosaccharid side chain in the globular head region are respons for the gener of antigen variant [ 36 ] . the ha1 of the virus from fav-003 and fav-009/10 had 19 and 16 amino acid chang respect at these major antigen site when compar with the h3n4 vaccin strain . In addit , the isol from the fav-003 submiss contain at least 8 amino acid differ in ha1 when compar to the swine h3n2 viru that it wa most close relat to phylogenet . accord to wilson and cox [ 35 ] , drift antigen variant of epidemiolog import could emerg if chang in the five antigen site involv more than 4 amino acid and the chang are locat in more than 2 of the 5 antigen site . the major chang in these newli isol virus were associ with antigen site A and B ( fig . 2 and fig . 3 ) , which are near the receptor bind site and often play a key role in role in escap from neutral antibodi . In both human and domest anim influenza variant frequent emerg as a result of point mutat in the HA gene , result in new variant that escap the host immun respons . the vaccin failur describ in thi studi is not surpris ; select of virus for anim influenza vaccin should be base on the result of recent epizootolog , virolog and immunolog surveil result . two of the h3n2 isol character in thi studi contain a uniqu combin of gene deriv from pandem h1n1 ( 2009 ) which underscor the need for contin- uou surveil and monitor of the genet chang of influenza A virus circul in domest anim to not onli aid in the select of the most appropri vaccin strain but to track the evolut of virus that might pose new threat to human and anim health . acknowledg We would like to thank Dr soren alexandersen for critic review of the manuscript .
