In 2004 , the antigen evolut of HA of human influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus wa map ( smith et al. , scienc 305 , 371â­376 , 2004 ) from it introduct in human in 1968 until 2003 . the current studi focus on the genet evolut of NA and compar it with HA use the dataset of smith and colleagu , updat to the epidem of the 2009/2010 season . phylogenet tree and genet map were construct to visual the genet evolut of NA and HA . the result reveal multipl reassort event over the year . overal rate of evolutionari chang were lower for NA than for ha1 at the nucleotid level . select pressur were estim , reveal an abund of neg select site and spars posit select site . the differ found between the evolut of NA and ha1 warrant further analysi of the evolut of NA at the phenotyp level , as ha been done previous for HA . introduct influenza epidem affect approxim 5â­15 % of the world popul , result in an estim 3â­5 million hospit and between 250 000 and 500 000 death annual ( sto â¨hr , 2002 ; who , 2003 ) . influenza type A virus can be divid into subtyp base on the antigen properti of the major surfac glycoprotein , haemagglu- tinin ( HA ) and neuraminidas ( NA ) . To date , 17 HA ( fouchier et al. , 2005 ; tong et al. , 2012 ) and nine NA ( schild et al. , 1980 ) subtyp have been found in natur . subtyp A ( h1n1 ) and A ( h3n2 ) are current the caus agent of influenza A viru epidem in human , of which the influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus are the most recur and virul ( barr et al. , 2010 ; taubenberg & moren , 2006 ) and show the strongest antigen drift ( rambaut et al. , 2008 ) . HA , a homotrimer type I integr membran protein , mediat viral entri into the cell by bind to sialic acid ( sauter et al. , 1989 ) . NA , a tetramer type II integr membran protein with sialidas activ , allow viru releas from the cell ( liu et al. , 1995 ; pales & compan , 1976 ; pales et al. , 1974 ) . both HA and NA are locat on the surfac of the viral membran and are the main target for antibodi . antibodi against influenza virus result in protect immun , but mutat in HA and NA allow the viru to escap host immun . thi process , known as antigen drift ( schild et al. , 1974 ) , is respons for the recurr of influenza epidem almost everi winter . vaccin have proven effect but need to be updat frequent due to antigen drift . sinc 1999 , the influenza A ( h3n2 ) viru compon ha been updat six time ( barr et al. , 2010 ) . thorough surveil by the nation the genbank/embl/ddbj access number for the sequenc determin in thi studi are avail in the supplementari data . four supplementari figur , five supplementari tabl and supplement- ari data are avail with the onlin version of thi paper . journal of gener virolog ( 2012 ) , 93 , 1996â­2007 doi 10.1099/vir.0.043059-0 1996 043059 G 2012 sgm print in great britain influenza center and who collabor center within the world health organ 's global influenza surveil- lanc network is requir to identifi the most suitabl strain to use in vaccin for the next epidem ( barr et al. , 2010 ; russel et al. , 2008 ) . vaccin strain select depend on three aspect : epidemiolog inform , HA and NA gene sequenc phylogeni and serolog analysi use an HA inhibit assay . the main focu of genet and antigen surveil is on HA , and offici influenza vaccin formul prescrib the amount of HA ( fior et al. , 2010 ) . although antibodi against NA do not prevent infect , numer pre-clin and clinic studi indic a role of NA immun in reduc the sever of influenza viru infect ( brett & johansson , 2005 ; couch et al. , 1974 ; johansson et al. , 1993 ; kilbourn , 1976 ; murphi et al. , 1972 ; schulman et al. , 1968 ) . earli crystallograph studi of NA have shown that antigen region surround the enzym 's highli conserv activ site ( colman et al. , 1983 , 1987 ) . antigen site A , B and C ( air et al. , 1985 ) have been shown to be highli variabl , probabl due to antigen drift ( laver et al. , 1982 ; luther et al. , 1984 ) . studi compar the antigen drift of HA and NA use limit number of virus have reveal that their evolut differ and is often asynchron ( kilbourn et al. , 1990 ; sandbult et al. , 2011 ; schulman & kilbourn , 1969 ) . given these factor , understand the pattern of evolu- tion in NA is import . In 2004 , smith et al . ( 2004 ) map the antigen evolu- tion of HA of human influenza A ( h3n2 ) viru from it introduct in human in 1968 until 2003 . the studi wa base on an extens dataset , compris influenza viru isol obtain within each influenza season . here , we focus on the genet evolut of NA and compar it with ha1 ( the immunogen section of the HA ) use the dataset of smith et al . ( 2004 ) , updat to the epidem of the 2009/2010 season . reassort event , rate of evolutionari chang and select pressur were analys over 40 year of influenza A ( h3n2 ) viru evolut . the differ found between the evolut of NA and ha1 warrant further analysi of the antigen properti of NA . result dataset background viru isol obtain between 1968 and 2003 and use in the studi of smith et al . ( 2004 ) were combin with 19 influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus isol between 2003 and 2009 into a singl updat dataset consist of 291 viru isol . the new isol includ seven vaccin or refer strain and 12 isol from epidem in the netherland , of which the latter were chosen base on diverg placement in the updat influenza A ( h3n2 ) antigen map ( de jong et al. , 2011 ) . all NA gene segment of these 291 virus were sequenc . for the studi by smith et al . ( 2004 ) , onli the ha1 code region were sequenc , as thi is the immunogen section of the HA protein ( wiley et al. , 1981 ; wilson & cox , 1990 ) . To obtain a similar dataset for HA and NA , the ha1 code region of the 19 recent influenza virus were sequenc . deduc amino acid sequenc align show onli posit with at least one mutat are avail in fig S1 and S2 for NA and ha1 , respect ( avail in jgv onlin ) . both align were colour code accord to the antigen cluster of HA ( smith et al. , 2004 ) . genet evolut of NA and ha1 maximum-likelihood ( ML ) phylogenet tree were con- struct to observ the genet evolut of NA and ha1 , updat from 2004 , at the nucleotid level ( fig . 1 ) . the gener topolog of the NA tree wa similar to that of the ha1 tree , show the typic ` ladder-lik ' gradual evolut with rapid replac of old strain by newer ( a ) ( b ) 0.1 hk68 en72 vi75 te77 bk79 si87 be89 be92 wu95 sy97 fu02 ca04 fig . 1 . phylogenet ML tree of the major glycoprotein of human influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus . the phylogenet ML tree of NA ( a ) and ha1 ( b ) were gener with 292 nt sequenc . the bar repres ~10 % of nucleotid substitut between close rel . the colour code of virus is base on the antigen cluster of HA ( smith et al. , 2004 ) and is consist between both tree . evolut of human h3n2 viru NA http : //vir.sgmjournals.org 1997 one . NA had fewer nucleotid substitut over 40 year of evolut compar with ha1 ; overal , the genet distanc from the root of the tree to the most recent cluster of ca04 strain wa roughli 1.5-fold greater for ha1 than for NA . although we did see that variant on the trunk were the ancestor of all variant in futur year ( fitch et al. , 1997 ) , the ha1 phylogeni did have some variant that cluster away from the trunk in an evolutionari termin or dead-end clade , most notabl for the vi75- and the be89-lik virus . compar with ha1 , such dead-end clade were less obviou in the NA tree . for NA , the most obviou Â­ yet rel small Â­ evolutionari dead-end clade includ a number of the sy97- and be92-lik virus . whilst the HA gene of the vi75-lik and be92-lik virus cluster continu in the ML tree , the NA gene appear as two separ lineag for both group of virus . notabl , the NA gene of hk68-like virus were more genet diverg than ha1 ( 0.044403 vs 0.03556 nucleotid substitut per site , respect ) . larger genet distanc were found between bk79- and si87-lik virus and within the sy97-lik virus for NA compar with ha1 . In contrast , the distanc between en72- and vi75- , between tx77- and bk79- , and between sy97- and fu02-lik virus were greater for ha1 . genet map were gener to visual the genet evolut of NA at the amino acid level ( fig . 2a ) . the ha1 genet map wa updat with the newli ad isol ( fig . 2b ) . In fig . 2 ( c ) , the two map are compar with arrow that point from the posit of a viru in the ha1 map to the posit of the correspond viru in the NA map . overal , the genet map of the NA appear less cluster and more gradual compar with the ha1 genet map . although the genet cluster of strain base on ha1 amino acid sequenc wa in good agree- ment with the antigen properti of the HA protein as describ previous ( smith et al. , 2004 ) , the NA amino acid sequenc did not strictli follow the same pattern of cluster . other featur of the NA genet map , includ the less pronounc evolutionari dead end ( yellow and ( b ) ( c ) ( a ) fig . 2 . genet map of the major glycoprotein of human influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus . genet map were gener with 291 aa sequenc and multidimension scale ( md ) algorithm for NA ( a ) and ha1 ( b ) . the vertic and horizont axe correspond to the number of amino acid substitut ; one squar repres five amino acid substitut . the orient of the ha1 and NA map wa chosen to match the orient of the antigen map of human influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus ( smith et al. , 2004 ) . the colour code of virus is base on the antigen cluster of HA and is consist among all map ( see legend to fig . 1 ) . the map in panel ( c ) depict the HA genet map with superimpos arrow point toward the correspond data point in the NA genet map .

( 2005 ) demonstr for a limit number of influenza season that multipl lineag of influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus co-circul , persist and rea- ssort in epidemiolog signific way . By appli the antigen cluster colour of HA ( smith et al. , 2004 ) to both the ha1 and NA tree , it wa note that the cluster of NA sequenc did not strictli coincid with those of HA ( fig . 1 ) . the ha1 and NA tree shown in fig . 1 were use in treemap to gener a tanglegram . A tanglegram enabl visual of the locat of particular isol within both ML tree . In the absenc of reassort , the twine should connect both tree , in theori , in a seamlessli horizont way . thi wa not the case for the isol use in thi studi , suggest frequent reassort between the NA and HA gene segment . howev , thi wa base on onli one phylogeni per gene segment , with clade and branch order by branch length in a fix fashion . To improv on thi , the comput softwar packag graph-incompatibility-bas reassort finder ( giraf ) wa use to identifi reassort in multipl tree per gene segment ( nagarajan & kingsford , 2011 ) . thi method compar larg collect of markov chain mont carlo ( mcmc ) -sampl tree for group of incompat split to identifi set of taxa with differenti phylogenet placement , whilst account for uncertainti in the infer phylogeni . We perform 100 independ giraf analys on ten independ mrbay HA run compar with ten independ mrbay NA run . each run consist of two independ tree file each with 1000 mcmc-sampl tree . giraf remov the first 500 of these tree as burn-in , and the remain 500 were use for the actual analysi . all reassort event are report in tabl S1 and those with a support valu of â¢50 % of the giraf run are depict on the tanglegram made from the ML tree as bold twine ( fig . 3 ) . A 50 % cut-off wa chosen arbitrarili . for the hk68-like virus , two possibl reassort event were report with 58 and 52 % support of the giraf run ( fig . 3 and tabl S1 ; event 1 and 2 , respec- tive ) . there wa no evid for reassort dure the circul of the en72-lik virus with support from giraf of â¢50 % . the vi75-lik virus in the ha1 tree form one clade , which descend from en72-lik virus , and thi clade form the common ancestor to tx77-like virus . In the NA tree , the vi75-lik virus were divid into two clade . the two differ clade repres two differ influenza season . the first clade , compris virus isol in 1975 and earli 1976 , wa directli descend from en72-lik virus , similar to the HA tree . In contrast , the second clade , consist of strain isol in earli 1977 , origin , togeth with the tx77- like virus , from late en72-lik virus . the virus contain the NA of the second clade were reassort , with a report support of 71 % of the giraf run ( event 3 ) . giraf provid no support for reassort between HA and NA dure circul of the tx77-like virus . vi75 en72 hk68 14 ( 60 ) ha1 1 ( 58 ) 2 ( 52 ) NA tx77 bk79 si87 be89 be92 wu95 sy97 fu02 ca04 8 ( 89 ) 16 ( 59 ) 19 ( 68 ) 3 ( 71 ) 4 ( 93 ) 5 ( 80 ) 6 ( 90 ) 7 ( 98 ) 15 ( 53 ) 9 ( 80 ) 10 ( 99 ) 11 ( 65 ) 12 ( 53 ) 17 ( 69 ) 18 ( 72 ) 13 ( 55 ) 20 ( 88 ) 21 ( 89 ) 22 ( 81 ) fig . 3 . reassort event between NA and ha1 dure 42 year of influenza A ( h3n2 ) evolut . treemap version 1.0 wa use to gener a tanglegram with the phylogenet ML tree shown in fig . 1 . twine between both tree were colour code accord to the antigen cluster of HA ( smith et al. , 2004 ; see legend to fig . 1 ) . giraf version 1.01 ( nagarajan & kingsford , 2011 ) wa use to detect reassort event between HA and NA . reassort event ( tabl S1 ) report in â¢50 % of the case are indic in bold , with percentag shown in parenthes . the arrow indic the introduct of an NA that repres the common ancestor of all more recent na . evolut of human h3n2 viru NA http : //vir.sgmjournals.org 1999 the bk79-like strain a/philippines/2/1982 wa a report reassort event with 93 % support ( event 4 ) . two strain with veri differ ha , one bk79- and the other si78-lik , both contain a close relat NA and were identifi as reassort in 80 % of the run ( event 5 ) . A/ hong kong/1/1989 , with an intermedi si87-lik HA and an NA that cluster with earli si87-lik virus , wa also report as a reassort ( event 6 , 90 % ) . multipl rea- ssortment event includ be92-lik virus , and five out of 14 were support by â¢50 % of the giraf report ( event 8 and 10â­13 ) . the most notabl observ wa that the be92-lik virus were divid into two clade in the NA tree , one descend from si87-lik virus and the second one from be89-lik virus . the upper clade includ virus circul from late 1991 until mid- 1993 , whilst the second clade contain virus circul from late 1992 until earli 1996 . the first isol of the second be92 clade and everyth descend from it were all report as a singl reassort- ment event support by 98 % of the giraf run ( event 7 ) . A similar event wa report for a more recent be92-lik viru and all it descend , although with weaker support ( event 9 , 80 % ) . both report suggest that , at some point dure the influenza season of 1992/1993 , an NA wa introduc by reassort that repres the common ancestor of the more recent na . multipl reassort event were report by giraf with- in and between the be92 and wu95 cluster . cluster of be92- and wu95-lik virus appear scatter in both tree , but when compar these scatter clade between the NA and HA tree , a number of clade posit dif- ferent . three reassort event that were support by â¢50 % of the run includ a mixtur of be92- and wu95-lik virus ( event 14â­16 ) . dure circul of the more recent wu95-lik virus , four reassort event were support by â¢50 % of the giraf run ( event 17â­20 ) . one reassort event involv sy97-lik virus wa support by giraf â¢50 % ( event 21 , 89 % ) . for fu02-lik virus , onli one reassort wa report ( event 22 , 81 % ) . reassort of HA and NA of ca04- like virus wa not support at â¢50 % by giraf . thu , visual inspect of a singl NA tree and a singl ha1 tree within the tanglegram suggest numer reassort event . infer from multipl mcmc-sampl tree provid support for a portion of these event , use an arbitrari cut-off of 50 % . overal , these data indic that , although mostli singular , reassort event have occur throughout the evolut of human influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus , especi dure the period of circul of be92- and wu95-lik virus . most reassort event were within antigen cluster , rather than between antigen cluster . there were 13 reassort event within the same HA antigen group ( event 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10â­13 and 17â­20 ) . there were six reassort event involv strain from differ HA group ( event 5 , 7 , 9 and 14â­16 ) . event 3 includ onli vi75-lik strain , but the na origin from late en72-lik virus instead of descend from vi75-lik virus . event 21 contain an NA deriv from wu95-lik virus and an HA descend from sy97-lik virus . reassort event 22 wa a fu02-lik strain , although the NA of thi viru origin from sy97-lik virus . wherea most reassort were not detect dure prolong period , possibl suggest that the reassort event were neutral or detriment , two reassort event ( event 7 and 9 ) persist in the popul . evolutionari rate rate of nucleotid substitut and time of the most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) for NA and ha1 were estim use beast version 1.6.2 with the relax log-norm clock and the bayesian skyrid time-awar model ( tabl 1 ) . the mean rate of nucleotid substitut for NA and ha1 were 3.1561023 ( hpd 2.8161023 â­3.4961023 ) and 5.1561023 ( hpd 4.6261023 â­5.7061023 ) nucleotid sub- stitut per site per year , respect . the time of mrca wa 1965.10 ( hpd , 1962.82â­1967.10 ) for NA and 1967.00 ( hpd , 1966.18â­1967.73 ) for ha1 . select pressur the degre of natur select act on NA and ha1 wa estim by look at the mean number of amino acid- chang ( non-synonym or dN ) and silent ( synonym- ou or dS ) substitut per site ( dn/d ratio ) use codeml . the overal dn/d and the mean dn/d ratio for the intern and extern branch were estim ( tabl 2 ) . both gene were under strong select ( NA dn/d tabl 1 . mean rate of nucleotid substitut and time of mrca of NA and ha1 hpd , highest probabl densiti . segment mean rate of nucleotid substitut ( â¾10 '' 3 substitut per site per year ) time of mrca mean 95 % hpd mean 95 % hpd lower upper lower upper NA 3.15 2.81 3.49 1965.10 1962.82 1967.10 ha1 5.15 4.62 5.70 1967.00 1966.18 1967.73 K.

In theori , a higher dn/d valu for the extern rel to the intern branch indic an excess of non-synonym mutat that are eventu remov from the viru popul by purifi select , suggest that these mutat are deleteri ( pybu et al. , 2007 ) . thi wa not the case for NA and ha1 . To determin the posit and neg select site along intern branch onli , where advantag muta- tion are more like to fall , the intern fix effect likelihood ( ifel ) method wa use ( kosakovski pond et al. , 2006 ) . ifel detect three posit select site in NA : codon 43 , 267 and 370 ( tabl S2 ) . In ha1 , nine posit select site were report , all locat in anti- genic site ( tabl S3 ) . site subject to episod diversifi select were iden- tifi use mix effect model of evolut ( meme ) ( kosakovski pond et al. , 2011 ) . meme detect five site ( codon 43 , 148 , 199 , 338 and 465 ) in NA ( tabl S2 ) and 14 in ha1 ( tabl S3 ) , of which all but two ( codon 31 and 185 ) were found in antigen site . direct posit select wa detect with the direc- tional evolut in protein sequenc ( dep ) test imple- ment in the hyphi packag ( kosakovski pond et al. , 2005 ) . the dep test identifi direct evolut toward residu at site within an amino acid align in combin with a nucleotid tree and is particularli use for the detect of select sweep ( kosakovski pond et al. , 2008 ) . for NA , 11 site ( tabl S2 and S4 ) were identifi to be involv in thi direct evolut ( see tabl S4 for the infer amino acid substitut pat- tern ) . for ha1 , nine site were involv ( tabl S3 and S5 ) . In contrast , thi method detect more site under direct select in NA compar with ha1 ( 11 and nine site , respect ) . the posit select site within ha1 ( tabl S3 ) were found mainli in the antigen site of ha1 ( with two except ) . one site , name 145 , wa detect by all three method . residu 31 , 133 , 135 , 137 , 159 , 186 , 193 , 226 and 262 were found by two of the method . for the posit select site found by the ifel , meme and dep analys , it wa note that onli a few were within antigen site of NA ( tabl S2 , residu 199 , 328 , 334 , 338 , 367 and 370 ) . all posit select site are indic in the NA monomer and tetramer protein diagram shown in fig . 4 ( a ) and ( b ) , respect . fig . S3 depict ML tree colour by each posit select site found by at least two method . the transit of codon 43 from an aspart acid to a serin occur around the time of the cluster transit from tx77 to bk79 . the chang of serin to an asparagin at posit 43 correspond with the emerg of the be89 cluster and all descend virus . the chang of arginin to leucin at posit 338 correl roughli with the transit from be92 to wu95 . the chang at posit 370 from leucin to serin and from serin back to leucin did not correspond with antigen cluster transit for HA , as they occur dure the continu circul of the hk68-like and bk79-like strain , respect . the late leucine-to-serin substitut correl roughli with the fu02 to ca04 transit . discuss In thi studi , we compar the genet evolut of NA of 291 human influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus sampl between 1968 and 2009 with that of ha1 . although similar were appar , the main observ wa that HA and NA exhibit clear differ in evolutionari genet . the gener topolog of the NA and ha1 tree were similar , show the typic ` ladder-lik ' gradual evolut with rapid replac of old strain by newer one , as describ previous for ha1 ( fitch et al. , 1997 ) . NA evolv more slowli at the nucleotid level and more gradual , with overal shorter branch and fewer and smaller evolutionari dead-end clade . the genet distanc between clade in the ML tree and in the genet map for NA and ha1 were often discord , suggest an asynchron genet evolut of the two gene . thi observ is in agreement with the report asynchron- ou evolut at the phenotyp level , with discord pattern of antigen drift of HA and NA , as measur by serolog assay ( kilbourn et al. , 1990 ; sandbult et al. , 2011 ; schulman & kilbourn , 1969 ) . reassort is a common featur in influenza virus ( webster et al. , 1992 ) . the asian , hong kong and 2009 swine flu pandem of 1957 , 1968 and 2009 , respect , all emerg follow reassort of swine , avian and/or human influenza virus ( scholtissek et al. , 1978 ; smith et al. , 2009 ) . In addit to the emerg of pandem strain , it ha been suggest that the emerg of new viru lineag dure season epidem of the past decad may have been associ with reassort event ( holm et al. , 2005 ) , perhap result from improv match of the activ of HA and NA in relat to HA antigen chang ( kaverin et al. , 2000 ; mitnaul et al. , 2000 ; wagner et al. , 2002 ) . howev , when amino acid substitu- tion in the activ site of HA and NA were analys , no evid for a ` match ' evolut of HA and NA wa tabl 2 . global , inner and outer dn/d valu for NA and ha1 segment sequenc length ( codon ) dn/d overal intern extern NA 470 0.249 0.250 0.248 ha1 329 0.362 0.350 0.371 evolut of human h3n2 viru NA http : //vir.sgmjournals.org 2001 found , as there were onli isol case of substitut in the catalyt site of NA ( specif at posit 151 ) that seem to provid no increas fit as their occurr were transient . for our influenza A viru dataset span .40 year of influenza A ( h3n2 ) viru epidem , differ in clu- stere of HA and NA gene segment within phylogenet tree inde suggest that reassort event had occur rel frequent over time . the larg genet distanc between NA sequenc of the hk68-like virus , shown in both the phylogenet ML tree ( fig . 1a ) and the genet map ( fig . 2a ) , could be explain by a reassort- ment event involv an earli influenza A ( h3n2 ) viru , in which a heterolog N2 gene of h2n2 viru origin wa reintroduc ( lindstrom et al. , 2004 ) . inde , in an ML tree gener with NA gene of all earli influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus and addit h2n2 strain , the NA of the late h2n2 virus cluster togeth with hk68-like virus of 1969 and 1970 ( data not shown ) . giraf analys provid further support that sever hk68-like strain ( a/bilthoven/17938/1969 , a/bilthoven/2668/1970 and A/ bilthoven/93/1970 ) were reassort . apart from these late hk68-like strain , giraf provid evid for reassort- ment event between 1971 and 1977 . co-circul of antigen distinct virus ha been report in thi period ( kendal et al. , 1978 ; pereira & chakraverti , 1977 ; schild et al. , 1973 ) , provid opportun for such reassort event . In agreement with a previou studi ( Xu et al. , 1996 ) , there wa also support for reassort event between be89- and be92-lik virus . giraf analys further suggest that reassort event between HA and NA of influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus occur particularli frequent dure the circul of be92- and wu95-lik virus . It remain unclear whether the frequenc of reassort event over time is signific and whether these reassort event have been of epidemiolog signific . analys with all genom sequenc would provid us with a better insight into reassort pattern . some concern aris from the use of giraf in the intra- h3n2-evolut context . the evolutionari distanc sam- pled in the present dataset are not the same as those giraf wa origin benchmark against , and the perform of giraf wa shown to depend on the distanc distri- bution . moreov , giraf seem to perform slightli better for single-taxa reassort compar with larger event . It should further be note that the low false-posit rate of giraf wa onli estim on synthet dataset assum neutral evolut model ( nagarajan & kingsford , 2011 ) . here , we use a tanglegram base on robust HA and NA ML tree to visual inspect the result report by giraf ( b ) ( a ) 127 372 367 370 199 437 148 267 308 328 334 338 465 fig . 4 . site identifi as be posit select , depict on the NA globular head . posit select site are shown on wire and filled-spac model of the monomer ( a ) and tetramer ( b ) NA structur construct use macpymol on subtyp N2 ( pdb code 2bat ; varghes et al. , 1992 ) . the viral receptor sialic acid , repres as red stick , is dock into the activ site , depict as yellow stick . all site locat in the globular head found to be posit select are illustr as sphere of which the residu visibl on the tetramer structur were given a colour : orang , 199 ; green , 328 ; blue , 334 ; magenta , 338 ; cyan , 367 ; brown , 370 ; lime , 372 ; purpl , 437 ; oliv , 465 . residu 127 , 148 , 267 and 308 ( grey ) were also found to be posit select but were not surfac expos . residu 43 , 46 and 52 are not shown , as they are in the NA stalk domain . number correl to codon posit identifi as under posit select found within thi studi ( tabl S2 ) . K. B. westgeest and other 2002 journal of gener virolog 93 as an independ test . the reassort event report by giraf with .50 % support could all be confirm by visual inspect of the tanglegram . To test whether the small genet distanc between the set of HA and NA sequenc were problemat for giraf , we also ran giraf on HA tree onli ( compar one set of HA tree with anoth set of HA tree ) and on NA tree onli , and use align in which the HA and NA sequenc were split into half . one would not expect to detect ani reassort event in these run . giraf analysi report onli three event for the 59haâ­39ha analysi , and no reassort event for the analysi of 59naâ­39na , haâ­ha and naâ­ NA tree . thu , we conclud from thi that the 22 haâ­ NA reassort event report in the present work are support by giraf and visual inspect . the evolutionari rate of NA and ha1 were high ( hanada et al. , 2004 ; jenkin et al. , 2002 ) and of the expect level for influenza virus ( bhatt et al. , 2011 ) . the evolutionari rate of NA of 3.15610â­3 nucleotid substitut per site per year wa slightli higher than a previous report rate ( 2.361023 ; Xu et al. , 1996 ) . although the rate of nucleotid substitut of NA wa lower than that of HA ( 5.15610â­3 nucleotid substitut per site per year ) , it is import to note that onli ha1 wa analys here . As ha1 is the most variabl part of the HA gene , thi part would probabl yield higher evolutionari rate than the full HA gene ( bhatt et al. , 2011 ) . the coalesc analys reveal that the time of circula- tion of the mrca of both ha1 and NA of influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus wa around 1965 and 1967 , respect ( tabl 1 ) . As the 95 % hpd for the mrca of both NA and ha1 overlap , it is like that there wa a singl seed event for the 1968 pandem , possibl prior to the first recognit in 1968 . the overal mean dn/d valu of 0.249 ( NA ) and 0.362 ( ha1 ) estim by the paml program ( tabl 2 ) were in agreement with previous report valu ( chen & holm , 2008 ) . there wa an abund of neg select site and a limit number of posit select site in both ha1 and NA ( tabl 2 , S2 and S3 ) . gener , the number of posit select site wa lower in NA compar with ha1 . In contrast , dep detect more site under direct select in NA compar with ha1 , which suggest that posit select in ha1 is more random , or it could reflect toggl of antigen site due to antibodi pressur . the posit select codon 43 , 46 and 52 are all locat in the highli variabl stalk region ( blok & air , 1982 ) . residu 199 , detect by meme , wa report previous as an antigen site ( gulati et al. , 2002 ) . residu 267 , detect by ifel , is not an antigen site but ha been report pre- viousli as be posit select ( kosakovski pond et al. , 2008 ) . two document antigen site , 328 ( air et al. , 1985 ) and 334 ( air et al. , 1985 ; laver et al. , 1982 ) , were detect by dep . residu 370 , a report antigen residu ( air et al. , 1985 ; laver et al. , 1982 ; lentz et al. , 1984 ) , wa found by ifel and dep as be posit select . By ifel , meme and dep , the number of posit select site found to be within antigen site in NA wa lower than in ha1 . In summari , we have analys the evolutionari genet of NA of influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus isol from 1968 to 2009 and compar them with those of HA . high-level similar were observ between the evolut of HA and NA , although notabl differ were appar . futur research on the evolut of NA should focu at the phenotyp level , use serolog test and antigen cartographi method , as describ recent ( kilbourn et al. , 1990 ; sandbult et al. , 2011 ; schulman & kilbourn , 1969 ) , on extens viru dataset . such analysi would allow not onli the side-by-sid comparison of HA and NA evolut at the genet level as carri out here but also it relationship with immun escap , the major driver of evolut of the surfac glycoprotein of influenza A viru . such analys , along with full viru genom data , ultim may lead to a better understand and increas predict of the evolut of influenza A ( h3n2 ) viru . method virus . human influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus , isol over 35 year of influenza viru surveil between 1968 and 2003 that were use in the studi of smith et al . ( 2004 ) , serv as the basi for thi studi . two virus within thi dataset were no longer avail ( a/victoria/ 7/87 and a/netherlands/440/93 ) and were thu exclud from the dataset . the dataset wa updat with 19 influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus circul between 2003 and 2009 , includ seven vaccin or refer strain and 12 isol from epidem in the netherland . the latter 12 isol were chosen base on diverg placement in the updat A ( h3n2 ) antigen map ( de jong et al. , 2011 ) . thi led to a total of 291 human influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus . human influenza A ( h3n2 ) virus were propag in madinâ­darbi canin kidney ( mdck ) cell or , if unsuccess , in 11-day-old embryon chicken egg . sequenc analysi . mdck supernat or allanto fluid wa use for rna extract , use a high pure rna isol kit ( roch appli scienc ) and cdna wa synthes with superscript iii revers transcriptas ( invitrogen ) . the complet NA and ha1 gene segment were amplifi by pcr use amplitaq gold dna polymeras ( appli biosystem ) and purifi by gel extract with a qiaquick gel extract kit ( qiagen ) . sequenc wa perform with na- or ha-specif primer use a bigdy termin version 3.1 cycl sequenc kit ( appli biosystem ) and a 3130 XL genet analyz ( appli biosystem ) , accord to the instruct of the manufactur . nucleotid sequenc of the NA orf and ha1 code region were align use the clustal W program run within the bioedit softwar packag , version 7.0.9.0 ( hall , 1999 ) . seven ha1 and 14 NA sequenc contain one or more degener nucleotid posit . In all ha1 and ten of the 14 NA sequenc , the degener nucleotid led to degener amino acid posit . one NA sequenc contain an insert of 3 nt between codon 221 and 222 , and one sequenc had a 3 nt delet at codon 154 . newli sequenc and previous publish NA and ha1 domain access number are provid in the supplementari data . evolut of human h3n2 viru NA http : //vir.sgmjournals.org 2003 phylogeni . nucleotid sequenc align with or without an addit outgroup ( a/duck/hokkaido/33/80 for ha1 and a/japan/ 305/1957 for NA ) were gener . with these nucleotid sequenc align , the best-fit model of nucleotid substitut were determin by jmodeltest ( posada , 2008 ) . In all case , the prefer ml-optim model of nucleotid substitut wa tvm+i+c4 ( transvers model with the proport of invari site and the gamma distribut of among-sit rate variat with four categori estim from the empir data ) with gtr+i+c4 ( gener time- revers model ) as second best base on the akaik inform criterion ( aic ) . As seven ha1 and ten NA nucleotid sequenc contain degener amino acid posit , either a B ( aspart or asparagin ) or an X ( ani amino acid ) wa appli at these posit . the best-fit model of protein evolut were determin with prottest ( darriba et al. , 2011 ) . the prefer ml-optim model wa hivw+c4 ( human immunodefici viru within ) for ha1 and hivw+i+c4+f ( equilibrium amino acid frequenc estim from the empir data ) for NA base on the aic . phylogenet analysi . with the nucleotid sequenc align , initi ML tree were infer use the phyml packag version 3.0 ( guindon & gascuel , 2003 ) , by mean of a full heurist search and the subtre prune and regraft ( spr ) method . As the tvm+i+c4 model of nucleotid substitut wa not an option within the phyml packag , the gtr+i+c4 model wa chosen for all dataset . garli version 0.951 ( zwickl , 2006 ) wa run on the best nucleotid tree from phyml for 2 million gener to optim tree topolog and branch length . addit , ML tree were estim use the tvm+i+c4 model of base substitut in combin with tree- bisection-reconnect ( tbr ) search use the paup* version 4.0b10 packag ( swofford , 2003 ) . for each of the tree , the reliabl of all phylogenet group wa determin through a non-parametr bootstrap resampl analysi : either 500 replic of ML tree use the gtr+i+c4 model and the spr method use phyml , or 1000 replic of neighbour-join tree estim under the ML substitut model use paup* . all tree are avail from the author upon request . tree were visual with the figtre program version 1.3.1 ( http : //tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ ) . tree were root on the outgroup strain ( a/duck/hokkaido/33/80 for ha1 and a/japan/305/1957 for NA ) or on the 1968 pandem strain ( A/ hong kong/1/1968 ) . amino acid align were use in combin with the hivw+c4 ( ha1 ) or hivw+i+c4+f ( NA ) model of protein evolut to infer ML tree use the phyml packag version 3.0 ( guindon & gascuel , 2003 ) by mean of a full heurist search and the spr method . genet map . amino acid sequenc align were use to calcul a distanc matrix with the number of amino acid sub- stitut between pair of strain to produc ` genet map ' , as describ previous ( smith et al. , 2004 ) . genet map is a way to facilit a quantit analysi and visual of genet data . In a genet map , the distanc between isol A and B correspond to the number of amino acid substitut between the amino acid sequenc of a particular protein-cod region of isol A and B . thu , each differ in an amino acid align can be thought of as specifi a target distanc for the point in a genet map . modifi md method are then use to arrang the point between two isol in a genet map to best satisfi the target distanc specifi by the amino acid align distanc matrix . the result is a map in which the distanc between point repres the number of amino acid substitut in a particular protein-cod region between isol . To avoid underestim genet distanc due to sequenti mutat at the same locat , a threshold need to be appli . for exampl , when a threshold of 30 is appli to the align , the softwar is free to use a distanc of at least 30 aa between two point that have a 30 aa differ in order to retriev the lowest error function . for ha1 , the previous determin threshold of 30 wa use ( smith et al. , 2004 ) . threshold consider for NA were base on adequ correl between observ distanc and genet map distanc and suffici correl between ML amino acid tree distanc and genet map distanc . the threshold that approach both consider best for NA wa 20 ( data not shown ) . the correl between the number of amino acid substitut and the correspond distanc between strain in the genet map wa 0.93 ( data not shown ) , indic that the two-dimension genet map is a reason represent of the target amino acid distanc matrix . for softwar , see http : //www.antigenic-cartography.org . detect of reassort . ML tree of NA and ha1 were use in treemap version 1.0 ( http : //taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treemap . html ) . treemap , origin design for compar host and parasit tree , wa appli sole to display a tanglegram between the HA and NA phylogeni . the twine were colour code accord to the HA antigen cluster ( smith et al. , 2004 ) . reassort event were identifi by the giraf program ( nagarajan & kingsford , 2011 ) . nucleotid align of ha1 or NA were use as input for mrbay ( huelsenbeck & ronquist , 2001 ; ronquist & huelsenbeck , 2003 ) to sampl 1000 unroot candid tree with the gtr+i+c4 substitut model , a burn-in of 100 000 and sampl everi 200 iter . these tree were subsequ use to model the phylogenet uncertainti for each segment with the giraf program under default set . thi procedur wa repeat 100 time with ten independ mrbay run for NA and ten independ mrbay run for ha1 . estim of nucleotid substitut rate and time of diverg . To identifi potenti error in sequenc data annot that might affect the clock estim , the ML nucleotid ha1 and NA tree were export to path-o-gen version 1.3 ( http : //tree.bio. . ac.uk/software/pathogen ; drummond et al. , 2003 ) and a linear regress plot for the year of sampl versu root-to-tip distanc wa gener ( fig . S4 ) . No anomali were seen in the NA and ha1 dataset , which both behav in a clock-lik manner ( R2 50.977 and R2 50.967 , respect ) . overal rate of evolutionari chang ( nucleotid substitut per site per year ) , mrca in year and rel genet divers were estim use the beast program version 1.6.2 ( http : //beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/ ; drummond & rambaut , 2007 ) . for all analys , the uncorrel log- normal relax molecular clock wa use to accommod variat in molecular evolutionari rate among lineag in combin with the srd06 codon posit model , with a differ rate of nucleotid substitut for the first plu second versu the third codon posit , and the hky85 substitut model ( shapiro et al. , 2006 ) . isol date were ad to calibr the molecular clock . thi analysi wa conduct with a time-awar linear bayesian skyrid coalesc tree prior ( minin et al. , 2008 ) over the unknown tree space , with rel uninform prior on all model paramet . two independ bayesian mcmc analys , perform for ha1 and NA for 100 million state , sampl everi 1000 state , were perform . converg and effect sampl size of the estim were check use tracer version 1.5 ( http : //tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/ ) and the first 10 % of each chain wa discard as burn-in . uncertainti in paramet estim is report as valu of the 95 % hpd . select pressur . To determin the degre of natur select act on ha1 and NA , the mean number of dN and dS substitut per site ( dn/d ratio or v ) wa estim use the ` one-ratio ' model of the codeml program implement in the paml packag ( yang , K. B. westgeest and other 2004 journal of gener virolog 93 2007 ) . codeml use the codon substitut model of goldman & yang ( 1994 ) for protein-cod dna sequenc and wa use in combin with the ML tree root on a/hong kong/1/68 . select pressur on the intern and extern branch of the ha1 and NA ML tree were estim with the ` two-ratio ' model of the codeml program . To determin the posit and neg select site along intern branch , the ifel method wa use ( kosakovski pond et al. , 2006 ) . site subject to episod diversifi select were identifi use meme ( kosakovski pond et al. , 2011 ) . both method were access through the datamonkey interfac ( http : //www.datamonkey.org ) and the gtr ( ha1 ) or tvm ( NA ) nucleotid substitut model wa use . site with a P valu ,0.05 were report as posit select site . direct posit select wa detect with the dep test implement in the hyphi packag ( kosakovski pond et al. , 2005 ) . for thi procedur , the ML tree with the a/hong kong/1/68 pandem strain as outgroup were use in combin with the amino acid align and the hivw model of protein evolut . posit select site were show on the monomer and tetramer NA structur construct use macpymol ( pymol molecular graphic system , version 13 ) on subtyp N2 ( pdb code 2bat ; varghes et al. , 1992 ) . acknowledg the author would grate like to thank Dr mathild richard for construct discuss , stefan van der vliet and oanh vuong for excel technic assist and ton marzec for provid part of the influenza A ( h3n2 ) viru isol .
