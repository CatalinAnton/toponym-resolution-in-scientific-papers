In the present studi , h9n2 virus isol from chicken , duck , and other minor poultri speci were character genet and antigen . our find demonstr that ck/bei-lik h9n2 virus have been introduc into mani differ type of poultri in southern china , includ quail , partridg , chukar , pheasant , guinea fowl , and domest duck , while g1-like virus were commonli detect in quail , less frequent detect in other minor poultri speci , and not detect in chicken and duck . genet analysi reveal 35 genotyp of h9n2 virus , includ 14 novel genotyp that have not been recogn befor . our result also suggest that two-way interspeci transmiss exist between differ type of poultri . our studi demonstr that the long-term cocircul of multipl viru lineag ( e.g. , h5n1 and h9n2 virus ) in differ type of poultri ha facilit the frequent reassort event that are mostli respons for the current great genet divers in h9n2 and h5n1 influenza virus in thi region . thi situat favor the emerg of influenza virus with pandem potenti . while highli pathogen h5n1 influenza virus have spread wide throughout eurasia and africa , anoth subtyp of in- fluenza virus , h9n2 , ha also becom endem in differ type of terrestri poultri in multipl countri on the eur- asian contin . epidemiolog and genet studi reveal that three distinct lineag of h9n2 influenza virus have been respons for outbreak event . these includ virus repres by chicken/beijing/1/94 ( ck/bei-lik ) , quail/ hong kong/g1/97 ( g1-like ) , and duck/hong kong/y439/97 ( y439-like or korean-lik ) . ck/bei-lik and g1-like virus have been preval mainli in china sinc the mid-1990 , while the g1-like virus have also been record as caus out- break in chicken in the middl east and germani ( 1 , 2 , 4 ) . while y439-like virus were isol from domest duck in hong kong in 1997 , similar virus have also been identifi from diseas outbreak in chicken in south korea sinc 1996 ( 8 , 17 ) . h9n2 influenza virus were detect onli in domest duck dure influenza viru surveil in southern china from 1976 to 1980 ( 28 ) . sinc the late 1990 , ck/bei-lik and g1-like h9n2 virus from southern china have becom pre- domin in chicken and quail , respect ( 11 , 12 ) . In 2000 , ck/bei-lik virus may have been transmit revers back to domest duck , wherein multipl reassort variant of h9n2 , or genotyp , were recogn in thi region ( 19 ) . mo- lecular epidemiolog studi of h9n2 virus from quail isol from 2000 to 2005 reveal that g1-like virus are still predomin in quail and are frequent reassort with either ck/bei-lik or h5n1/01-like virus to gener novel reassort . while onli four g1-like reassort were de- tect in quail , there were 16 differ genotyp of ck/bei- like h9n2 virus . those h9n2 variant from quail , particu- larli ck/bei-lik virus , contain gene segment from multipl sourc , includ those close relat to highli pathogen h5n1 influenza virus . thi updat inform suggest that two-way transmiss between quail and chick- en occur frequent , as the genotyp of ck/bei-lik vi- ruse were transient and did not becom establish in quail ( 31 ) . although the quail is consid a possibl intermedi host for the introduct of influenza virus from aquat bird to terrestri poultri speci ( 26 ) , thi speci is onli one type of minor poultri speci and chicken still account for approxim 70 % of the total poultri popul in china . It is note that in the past 2 decad , a varieti of bird , collec- tive name minor poultri speci , includ pheasant , chukar , partridg , guinea fowl , and pigeon , have also been farm . these oper dramat increas the complex- * correspond author . mail address : state key laboratori of emerg infecti diseas , depart of microbiolog , the uni- versiti of hong kong , Li Ka shing faculti of medicin build , 21 sassoon road , pokfulam , hong kong , sar , china . phone : ( 852 ) 28199830 . fax : ( 852 ) 28171958 . e-mail : yguan @ hkucc.hku.hk . publish ahead of print on 25 juli 2007 . 10389 iti of the influenza viru ecosystem in thi region . recent studi suggest that most influenza A viru subtyp could replic asymptomat in similar kind of bird under lab- oratori condit ( 16 , 21 ) . howev , the impact of such chang in the poultri industri on influenza viru ecolog ha not been investig . In addit to the quail isol , h9n2 influenza virus have also been isol regularli from both chicken and other minor poultri speci in our surveil program in southern china , but their genet divers and mechan of genesi have not been determin sinc 1999 . the interrelationship of h9n2 influenza virus from differ type of poultri are still not determin . thi situat highlight the necess of ex- plore the possibl role of differ type of poultri in the ecolog of influenza viru in southern china , while the broad distribut of h9n2 influenza virus in those bird provid such an opportun . previou studi reveal that h9n2 influenza virus from poultri could occasion be transmit from poultri to mammalian speci , includ human and pig ( 3 , 20 , 24 , 25 , 30 ) . the ck/bei-lik and g1-like virus were initi recog- nize from both a human and pig in the late 1990 and were also observ in 2003 and recent in hong kong ( 5 ) . genet analys demonstr that the human h9n2 influenza viru isol in 2003 wa a novel reassort and most like origi- nate directli from local live poultri market ( 3 ) . these recent interspeci transmiss event suggest that current h9n2 influenza viru variant are still potenti infecti for hu- man . our long-term influenza viru surveil program in south- ern china focus mainli on major poultri , includ chicken , duck , and gees . In addit , we also sampl a varieti of other minor poultri speci . In the present studi , h9n2 influ- enza virus isol from chicken , domest duck , and other minor poultri speci from 2000 to 2005 were character genet and antigen . the find of the present studi demonstr that ck/bei-lik h9n2 virus have been intro- duce into mani differ type of poultri in thi region , in- clude quail , partridg , chukar , pheasant , guinea fowl , and domest duck , while g1-like virus were commonli detect in quail , less frequent detect in other minor poultri spe- cie , and not detect in chicken and duck . genet studi reveal that two-way interspeci transmiss exist between differ type of poultri . phylogenet analysi suggest that the long-term cocircul of multipl viru lineag ( e.g. , h5n1 and h9n2 virus ) in differ type of poultri facili- tate frequent reassort event that were mostli responsi- ble for the current great genet divers in h9n2 and h5n1 variant in thi region ( 6 , 10 , 11 , 18 ) . the present studi pro- vide insight into the genesi and evolut of h9n2 influenza virus in southern china . the current influenza viru ecosys- tem in southern china favor the emerg of influenza vi- ruse with pandem potenti . materi and method sampl and viru isol . our previou studi character h9n2 vi- ruse from quail , which wa consid a `` minor poultri speci . '' therefor , minor poultri speci in the present studi , name , chukar , guinea fowl , par- tridg , and pheasant , are refer to as `` other minor poultri speci . '' A total of 47,255 chicken and 6,925 bird of other minor poultri speci were sampl from six provinc in southern china between juli 2000 and decemb 2005 . dure the same period , a total of 49,150 duck were also sampl . Of those sampl , 20,535 chicken , 3,008 other minor poultri speci , and 5,381 duck specimen were pair tracheal and cloacal swab , while the remain speci- men were either cloacal or fecal swab . our influenza viru surveil program wa carri out as previous report ( 30 ) . In brief , surveil wa initi in guangdong in juli 2000 . sinc 2002 , thi program wa gradual expand to five other provinc in thi region , includ fujian , guangxi , guizhou , hunan , and yunnan . virus were isol in 9- to 11-day-old embryon chicken egg as previous describ ( 18 , 19 ) . antigen analysi . all viru isol were subtyp by standard hemaggluti- nation inhibit ( HI ) and neuraminidas ( NA ) inhibit test , use a panel of world health organ refer antisera as previous describ ( 3 ) . an- tigen analysi wa perform use three differ panel of monoclon anti- bodi ( mab ) , against qa/hk/g1/97 , dk/hk/y280/97 , and ck/hk/g9/97 , as previous describ ( 31 ) . all mab were produc at the depart of in- fectiou diseas , st. jude children 's research hospit , TN ( 7 ) . numer analysi of HI titer wa conduct use primer , version 5.2.9 ( primer- , plymouth , unit kingdom ) , also as previous describ ( 31 ) . phylogenet and molecular analys . one or two viru isol from each posit sampl occas were select for character . viral rna extrac- tion , cdna synthesi , pcr , and sequenc were carri out as previous describ ( 12 ) . all eight gene segment sequenc from these virus were character and phylogenet analyz with avail viru sequenc data from genbank . the program mrmodeltest 2.2 ( 23 ) wa use to determin the appropri dna substitut model and -rate heterogen . the gener model wa use in all subsequ analys . neighbor-join tree were con- struct use paup* 4.0 ( 29 ) , and bayesian analysi wa conduct with mr- bay 3.1 ( 15 ) by use two replic of 1 million gener with six chain , sampl everi 100 gener . estim of the phylogeni were calcul by perform 1,000 neighbor-join bootstrap replic , and bayesian posterior probabl were calcul from the consensu of 18,000 tree after exclud the first 2,000 tree as burn-in . genotyp definit . viru genotyp were defin by gene phylogeni .

A total of 103,300 sampl were collect from chicken , duck , and other minor poultri speci from 2000 to 2005 . In gener , h9n2 virus were isol from appar healthi bird year-round in live poul- tri market in southern china , but the isol rate wa usu- alli higher in the winter season than in the summer season ( fig . 1 ; tabl 1 ) . the major of virus were isol from chicken and other minor poultri speci , while duck test posit on veri few sampl occas , except for those in 2000 and 2001 ( fig . 1 ) . there were 1,189 strain of h9n2 influenza virus isol from 47,225 chicken sampl ( overal isol rate , 2.5 % ) ( tabl 1 ) . Of these virus , 944 were isol from 20,535 tracheal swab ( isol rate , 4.6 % ) , while 245 strain were isol from 26,690 cloacal or fecal swab ( isol rate , 0.9 % ) ( tabl 2 ) . It is noteworthi that the rate of isol of h9n2 virus from fecal materi and cloacal sampl declin from 5.4 % in 2000 to 0.5 % in 2005 , while there wa no dra- matic chang in the isol rate for tracheal sampl from chicken dure the studi period ( tabl 2 ) . thi suggest that h9n2 influenza virus have gradual adapt to replic in the respiratori tract of chicken . 10390 XU ET AL . J. virol . A total of 89 h9n2 virus were isol from 49,150 duck sampl ( overal isol rate , 0.18 % ) ( tabl 1 ) . fifty-on of these h9n2 virus were isol from 2,959 specimen ( iso- lation rate , 1.7 % ) dure 2000 to 2001 , while onli 38 virus were isol from 46,191 cloacal or fecal swab ( isol rate , 0.08 % ) from 2002 to 2005 ( fig . 1 ; tabl 1 ) . while tracheal swab were collect onli in 2005 , onli a singl h9n2 viru wa isol from 5,381 sampl , indic that the major site of h9n2 influenza viru replic in the duck is the intestin . the isol rate of h9n2 influenza virus from duck have declin sinc 2002 , with duck test posit infrequ ( fig . 1 ; tabl 1 ) . three hundr twenty-eight h9n2 influenza virus were isol from a total of 6,925 sampl collect from other minor poultri speci ( overal isol rate , 4.7 % ) ( tabl 1 ) . Of these virus , 292 were isol from tracheal swab , while onli 36 strain were isol from cloacal or fecal swab ( tabl 2 ) . there is a clear replic pattern where h9n2 virus replic mainli in the respiratori tract , not the intestin , in other minor poultri speci . antigen analysi . the antigen properti of representa- tive h9n2 influenza virus were investig with a panel of mab rais against qa/hk/g1/97 , dk/hk/y280/97 , and ck/ hk/g9/97 by HI assay ( tabl 3 ) . numer analysi of HI titer wa conduct to visual the antigen variat and reveal three distinct group that were in agreement with the result of phylogenet analys ( fig . 2 ; see below ) . one group includ two virus from other minor poultri speci , gf/st/ 2076/01 and cu/st/22116/05 , which react well with two qa/ hk/g1/97 mab and both ck/hk/g9/97 mab , a reaction pattern similar to that of qa/hk/g1/97 . the remain two group contain ck/bei-lik virus ( subgroup 1 and 2 ) . ck/ bei-lik subgroup 2 virus were isol from both chicken and other minor poultri speci and react well with all test mab , except g1-9 and 1073-9 , a pattern similar to that of the prototyp viru , dk/hk/y280/97 ( fig . 2 ; tabl 3 ) . ck/bei-lik fig . 1 . comparison of h9n2 influenza viru isol rate from chicken ( a ) , other minor poultri speci ( b ) , and duck ( c ) from southern china , juli 2000 to decemb 2005 . surveil wa conduct in live poultri market in fujian , guangdong , guangxi , guiyang , hunan , and yunnan provinc . * , posit sampl occas with low isol rate of 0.3 % . vol . 81 , 2007 genesi and evolut OF h9n2 influenza viru 10391 subgroup 1 virus were mostli isol from other minor poultri speci and had high HI titer against mab y280-8c4 and onli moder reactiv to y280-18b10 , a reactiv pat- tern similar to that of the recent human h9n2 isol ( hk/ 2108/03 ) and a wild duck isol ( wdk/st/4108/01 ) ( fig . 2 ; tabl 3 ) . phylogenet analysi of surfac gene . To better understand the evolutionari pathway of h9n2 virus in southern china , 112 of 1,189 ( 9.4 % ) virus from chicken and 79 of 328 ( 9.4 % ) virus from other minor poultri speci were sequenc . A further 15 of 79 ( 19 % ) h9n2 virus from duck , isol from 2001 to 2005 , were also sequenc . At least one isol from each posit sampl occas wa sequenc . those se- quenc data were analyz phylogenet togeth with data avail in public databas . phylogenet analysi of the H9 HA gene show that the major of isol test belong to the ck/bei-lik lineag . three isol from other minor poultri speci ( gf/st/2076/01 , pa/st/2875/01 , and cu/st/ 22116/05 ) cluster within the g1-like lineag , and two isol from duck ( dk/st/163/04 and dk/st/7448/04 ) had a korean- like HA gene ( fig . 3a ) . the ck/bei-lik lineag contain two subgroup , includ subgroup 1 , repres by qa/st/243/ 00 , and subgroup 2 , repres by dk/hk/y280/97 , as de- scribe in our previou studi ( 31 ) . all h9n2 virus from chicken belong to subgroup 2 , with the except of three virus ( sck/st/473/04 , sck/st/999/04 , and ck/st/6786/04 ) that cluster in subgroup 1 ( fig . 3a ) . similarli , the HA gene of all ck/bei-lik duck virus fell into subgroup 2 , except for a singl viru ( dk/st/3658/03 ) that belong to subgroup 1 .

In the present studi , we genet and antigen character h9n2 virus isol from chicken , duck , and other minor poultri speci in our surveil from 2000 to 2005 . all h9n2 virus from chicken and most of the virus from duck and other minor poultri speci belong to the ck/bei-lik lineag , while g1-like virus prevail mainli in quail and were rare detect in other minor poultri speci . phylogenet studi reveal that two-way interspeci trans- mission occur between differ type of poultri and that reassort event among establish viru lineag ( e.g. , h5n1 and h9n2 virus ) were mostli respons for the cur- rent great genet divers in h9n2 and h5n1 variant in thi region . even though mani novel reassort have been gener , rel host restrict is present for h9n2 virus . quail are abl to harbor both ck/bei-lik and g1-like virus and may play a central role in the current ecosystem of southern china ( fig . 6 ) , while chicken could support onli ck/bei-lik virus , but other minor poultri speci seem to be in between quail and chicken , as most of their isol were ck/bei-lik , with a few g1-like virus . It wa also note that onli a few ck/bei- like virus have been recogn in domest duck sinc 2002 ( fig . 1 and tabl 6 ) . these find suggest that the current direct of gene flow of ck/bei-lik h9n2 virus is from chicken to quail , other minor poultri speci , and duck . g1- like virus and those ck/bei-lik virus with g1-like gene segment could be introduc from quail to other minor poul- tri speci . It is note that g1-like virus were not detect in chicken in the present studi but did caus outbreak in chicken in middl eastern and european countri , includ iran , saudi arabia , unit arab emir , and germani ( 1 , 2 , 4 ) . even though those g1-like virus underw further reassort with `` local '' influenza virus and gener novel reassort ( 1 ) , the reason that g1-like virus have not been detect in other type of terrestri poultri in our surveil are still unknown . obvious , the g1-like virus detect in southern china and middl eastern countri share the same progen- itor and evolutionari pathway . thu , current g1-like virus in southern china might have origin been introduc from middl eastern countri , or it is also like that the viru spread the other way around , similar to the transmiss of fig . 6 . ecolog of h9n2 influenza virus in southern china . `` A '' and `` B '' shown in black box indic qa/hk/g1/97-lik and ck/bei/1/94-lik viru lineag , respect . solid line repres confirm gene flow direct . dash line indic indirect evi- denc of gene flow . tabl 6 . distribut of differ h9n2 viru genotyp among differ type of poultri from southern china year genotyp ( no . of isol ) a chicken other minor poultri speci quail ducksb 2000 B3 ( 8 ) B1 ( 2 ) , B2 ( 1 ) , B3 ( 1 ) , B5 ( 2 ) A0 ( 3 ) , A1 ( 1 ) , B1 ( 1 ) , B2 ( 1 ) , B3 ( 1 ) B1 ( 2 ) , B3 ( 5 ) , B4 ( 1 ) , B5 ( 1 ) , b-n8 ( 1 ) 2001 B0 ( 3 ) , B3 ( 8 ) , B4 ( 2 ) A0 ( 2 ) , B3 ( 2 ) , B4 ( 1 ) , B7 ( 2 ) A0 ( 4 ) , A1 ( 3 ) , A2 ( 1 ) , B3 ( 1 ) , B4 ( 1 ) , B5 ( 3 ) , B6 ( 1 ) B3 ( 4 ) , B7 ( 1 ) , b-n6 ( 1 ) 2002 B3 ( 7 ) , b17 ( 1 ) , b18 ( 3 ) B3 ( 2 ) , B7 ( 5 ) , B8 ( 2 ) A0 ( 2 ) , A3 ( 3 ) , B3 ( 1 ) , B7 ( 2 ) , B8 ( 3 ) B3 ( 2 ) , b12 ( 1 ) 2003 B3 ( 3 ) , b18 ( 2 ) , b19 ( 1 ) , b20 ( 1 ) , b21 ( 5 ) , b22 ( 1 ) B2 ( 2 ) , B3 ( 1 ) , B7 ( 11 ) , b12 ( 1 ) , b21 ( 3 ) , b23 ( 1 ) A3 ( 7 ) , B7 ( 6 ) , B9 ( 1 ) , b10 ( 1 ) , b11 ( 1 ) , b12 ( 1 ) , b13 ( 1 ) B3 ( 1 ) , B7 ( 1 ) , b21 ( 2 ) 2004 B3 ( 5 ) , b18 ( 2 ) , b21 ( 1 ) , B7 ( 4 ) , b12 ( 1 ) , b14 ( 5 ) , b15 ( 1 ) , b25 ( 2 ) B3 ( 1 ) , B7 ( 16 ) , B8 ( 1 ) , b14 ( 8 ) , b15 ( 2 ) , b24 ( 1 ) A3 ( 5 ) , B7 ( 1 ) , b14 ( 2 ) , b15 ( 3 ) b21 ( 1 ) 2005 B3 ( 2 ) , B7 ( 1 ) , b14 ( 14 ) , b15 ( 21 ) , b25 ( 1 ) , b16 ( 1 ) , b26 ( 1 ) , b27 ( 1 ) , b28 ( 3 ) , b29 ( 1 ) A4 ( 1 ) , B3 ( 1 ) , B7 ( 2 ) , b14 ( 1 ) , b15 ( 1 ) , b16 ( 3 ) A3 ( 4 ) , B8 ( 3 ) , b14 ( 1 ) , b15 ( 2 ) , b16 ( 2 ) b15 ( 1 ) a number of isol recogn among repres strain test . b virus character in refer 19 were also includ . vol . 81 , 2007 genesi and evolut OF h9n2 influenza viru 10399 qinghai-lik h5n1 viru from the east transmit in a west- ern or northwestern direct ( 6 ) . It ha been understood that there is influenza viru gene exchang between the extrem of europ and asia ( 9 ) . the present studi reveal that prototyp of ck/bei-lik and g1-like virus ( genotyp B0 and A0 ) have been replac by their descend reassort sinc 2002 and 2003 , respec- tive ( tabl 6 ) . genotyp B3 and B7 were persist in either chicken or other minor poultri speci from 2001 to 2005 , but these two genotyp still have not becom predomin in their host , as novel reassort continu to emerg everi year ( fig . 5 and tabl 6 ) . thi suggest that the ck/bei-lik virus are of genet unstabl and transient gene constel . thi situat could give rise to great uncertainti for the cur- rent ecosystem in southern china . first , novel reassort could continu to have further interspeci transmiss and further reassort with other virus to caus new outbreak ; and second , novel reassort keep challeng the speci barrier between bird and mammal . the find of the present investig show a dynam ecosystem with multipl interspeci transmiss of h9n2 influenza viru ( fig . 6 ) . two-way transmiss of h9n2 be- tween differ type of poultri in southern china promot the develop of variou genotyp , not onli for h9n2 but also for h5n1 and other influenza virus . the combin of a dynam h9n2 ecosystem and the presenc of multipl novel genotyp increas the risk of h9n2 virus enter the hu- man popul themselv or , like the hong kong h5n1 bird flu incid ( 11 ) , indirectli contribut their intern gene complex to promot the introduct of other subtyp to human . thi situat ha pose a persist and signific pandem threat in the past 10 year . howev , to reduc thi kind of risk , these interspeci transmiss must be dis- rupt . thi studi provid clear clue about how to interrupt these two-way transmiss between differ poultri speci , e.g. , with modifi market system and farm practic in the affect region . h5n1 virus have usual caus infect with high mor- taliti in human , which result in earli detect and preven- tion of further adapt and reassort to develop human- to-human transmiss ; howev , h9n2 human infect manifest with a typic human flu-lik ill that can easili be overlook ( 3 , 5 ) . At thi point , h9n2 virus have a greater chanc and time to develop the abil of human-to-human transmiss . continu influenza viru surveil of both anim and human aspect seem to be the best option for detect and interrupt thi kind of develop . acknowledg thi studi wa support by the Li Ka shing foundat , the research fund for control of infecti diseas and research grant council ( hku1/05c ) of the hong kong sar govern , and the nation institut of health ( niaid contract hhsn266200700005c ) . refer 1 . aamir , U .
