To explor the mutat basi for increas virul in the lung , the h3n2 prototyp clinic isol , ahk168 , wa adapt to the mous . genom sequenc provid the first demonstr , to our knowledg , that a group of 11 mutat can convert an avirul viru to a virul variant that can kill at a minim dose . thirteen of the 14 amino acid substitut ( 93 % ) detect among clonal isol were like instrument in adap- tation becaus of their posit select , locat in function region , andor independ occurr in other virul influenza virus . mutat in virul variant repeatedli involv nuclear local signal and site of protein and rna interact , implic them as novel modul of virul . mouse-adapt variant with the same hemagglutinin mutat possess dif- ferent pH optima of fusion , indic that fusion activ of hemagglutinin can be modul by other viral gene . experimen- tal adapt result in the select of three mutat that were in common with the virul human h5n1 isol ahk 15697 and that may be instrument in it extrem virul . analysi of viral adapt by serial passag appear to provid the identif of biolog relev mutat . virul is the measur of the abil of a pathogen to damag it host . human influenza A viru infect typic caus tracheobronch with a low incid of fatal pneumo- nia . In 1918 , a virul influenza A viru variant aros , caus a devast pandem kill 50 million peopl ( 1 ) . although thi viru wa not isol , it must have possess mutat that increas it virul . the genom sequenc of 1918 virus are be determin from archiv tissu and , wherea the sequenc of the hemagglutinin ( HA ) and neuraminidas ( NA ) gene are now avail ( 2 ) , we do not yet have the understand- ing of the molecular basi for virul need to interpret thi inform . the difficulti of discern mutat that control virul among the background of unselect mutat ha been exemplifi by sequenc analysi of the highli virul ahong kong15697-lik ( h5n1 ) viru that recent infect human directli from bird in hong kong ( HK ) ( 3 ) , where even the most close relat avian isol , ackhk22097 , differ from thi viru at 28 amino acid ( 4 ) . subsequ human infect by relat avian h9n2 virus indic a continu threat to the human popul ( 1 ) . there is thu a need to understand the genet basi for virul in influenza viru variant , with the hope that specif mutat will be indic and thu predictor of virul . No clinic isol of human influenza viru are known to differ in virul ( 5 ) , therefor necessit the analysi of infect in anim . influenza viru is partial host restrict , where viru from one host doe not normal transmit or caus diseas in other host . the ahk15697 strain , howev , is virul for both chicken and mice ( 6 ) , indic that a share genet basi for diseas product can exist among speci . adapt of human influ- enza viru to mice by serial passag result in the select of highli virul variant that have acquir mutat in multipl gene ( 7â­9 ) . analys of the genet basi for virul by use reassor- tant that possess mixtur of gene from virul and avirul strain have identifi variou group of gene , which in aggre- gate implic all eight genom segment ( 8 ) . these data have led to the untest assumpt that virul can not be genet predict , becaus there are too mani degre of freedom in the control of virul . A goal of the studi of influenza pathogenesi is to defin the role of each viral gene in diseas product . To begin to address thi aim , a complet sequenc comparison wa done between the afm147 ( h1n1 ) parent strain ( FM ) and it mouse-adapt variant , fm-ma , which had increas 104.6 -fold in virul on the basi of ld50 . thi process identifi singl amino acid substitut in 5 of it 10 gene ( 9 ) . reintroduct of each of these mutat into the parent FM strain confirm their role not onli in increas virul but also in replic fit for the mous ( 9 ) . these find are compel , becaus they show a clear relation- ship between replic fit and the abil to damag the host . It wa also surpris that the MA variant did not possess unselect mutat that typic accumul in clinic isol . thi , how- ever , would be predict from studi of viral adapt in cell cultur , where genet variat is a function of viru popul size ( 10 ) . serial passag of larg popul of viru under novel condit permit competit among all possibl mutant with the select of optim genotyp . In contrast , the transfer of small popul , typic of normal diseas transmiss , lead to the fixat of unselect and deleteri mutat becaus of sto- chastic effect , a process term muller 's ratchet ( 10 ) . the primari featur of organ with adapt mutat is that they increas in preval in the popul becaus of improv replic fit . A strong indic of adapt chang at the molecular level is converg evolut , character by the re- peat and independ occurr of common mutat in adapt variant . the occurr of ident mutat is term parallel evolut , and mutat at the same site but with differ amino acid is term direct evolut , both of which are characterist of instanc of converg evolut ( 11 ) . thi is the standard criterion for identifi mutat respons for drug and inhibitor resist , provid evid for converg evolu- tion in mani organ , includ influenza viru ( 12 ) . abbrevi : mdck , madinâ­darbi canin kidney ; MA , mous adapt ; pb1 , pb2 , and PA , rna polymeras subunit ; HA , hemagglutinin ; NP , nucleoprotein ; NA , neuraminidas ; ns1 , nonstructur protein ; HK , hong kong ; pfu , plaque-form unit . data deposit : the sequenc report in thi paper have been deposit in the genbank databas ( access no . af348170â­af348206 ) .

To identifi the mutat respons for the increas abil to caus fatal lung infect , we initi se- quenc the genom of the most virul clonal isol , hkma20c , as well as the HK parent for comparison . A total of 11 amino acid substitut involv 8 of the 10 viral protein ( tabl 2 ) and 4 silent substitut were detect , which pro- duce 2 code chang in each of PA , HA , and nucleoprotein ( NP ) , as well as singl amino acid substitut in pb2 , NA , M1 , M2 , and ns1 , and no mutat in polymeras subunit pb1 and nuclear export protein ns2 . the noncod chang ( data not shown ) includ an insert of an extra A in the polya code region of the NA gene ( tabl 2 ) . although it is clear that these mutat as a group must account for the differ in biolog of the hkma20c variant , it is not clear that they are all instrument in adapt to increas virul . becaus adapt chang increas replica- tive fit , virus that possess these chang will be present at a greater frequenc in the viru popul than their rate of format predict from the mutat frequenc . To detect mutat that were posit select on mous adapt , we test for the null hypothesi that the mutat in individu viru clone were randomli and thu independ gener . given the observ frequenc of code mutat in hkma20c of 2.2 103 amino acid , the probabl of have two virus with the same mutat becaus of independ mutat event is predict by chanc to be P 5 106 n 1 , where n is the number of isol test . the occurr of the same mutat in more than one isol is thu signific evid of posit select rather than the occurr of independ mutat event . the hkma12 and hkma20 variant were subject to sequenc analysi to determin whether they share mutat with hkma20c . genom seg- ment four to eight were complet sequenc , as well as the mutant loci detect in the pb2 and PA gene . the hkma12 clone possess 5 mutat in common with both of the passag 20 clone , and hkma20 possess 6 mutat in common with hkma20c , indic posit select of 6 mutat ( tabl 2 ) . the low probabl of pair of virus with five or six mutat in common is also a clear indic of posit select , as thi is extrem unlik to occur by chanc ( poisson distribut P 1 1013 and P 1.4 1017 ) . becaus two more mutat were detect in the hkma20 clone ( m1-asp-2323asn and ns1-val-233ala ) , segment 7 and 8 ( M1 , M2 , ns1 , and ns2 gene ) were sequenc for hkma-12 , 12a , 12b , and the 5 remain hkma20 seri of clone ( tabl 1 ) . thi analysi identifi a further mutat , ns2-lys-883arg , and demonstr posit select for 4 of 6 mutat in the M and NS gene ( tabl 3 ) . protein chang . the ha2-thr-1563asn substitut is ex- pect to result in the loss of a glycosyl site that would be detect by increas mobil on sdspage . electrophore- si of infect mdck cell protein show that the uncleav form of HA protein ( ha0 ) possess higher electrophoret mobil than HK for 3 of 6 passag 12 clone and 6 of 6 passag 20 clone ( fig . 1A ) . the increas electrophoret mobil wa caus by decreas glycosyl , becaus the unglycosyl form of their ha0 protein result from tunicamycin treat- ment were indistinguish in electrophoret mobil from the parent viru ( fig . 1B ) , and the HA of hkma12a wa distinct in it properti . the mutat affect glycosyl were confirm to map to the ha2 subunit by trypsin cleavag of fig . 1 . sdspage of protein of parent and MA clone of ahk168 .

A total of 14 code mutat and one insert mutat were observ on mous adapt of HK . the posit select of 11 of 14 mutat indic they confer a replic advantag ; howev , there is also reason to believ that the re- main three mutat observ in individu clone from the passag 20 popul were also adapt . the glu-1333gli mutat in the PA protein occur in the middl of the first nuclear local signal at amino acid 124â­139 ( fig . 4 ; ref . 12 ) and may affect thi activ . the m1-thr-1673ala mutat wa independ select in 1972 to becom fix in the h3n2 lineag ( data not shown ) , indic that thi mutat ha been select on human passag . the ns2-lys-883arg mutat wa found in sever virul virus , includ the virul hong kong h5n1 lineag of virus , suggest that thi is an adapt mutat that play a role in modul virul ( data not shown ) . thu 13 of 14 mutat detect on mous passag of HK viru were deem to be instrument in adapt to increas virul , becaus they either were be posit select , involv function import region of protein ( discuss below ) andor were found to have occur independ in other virul influenza virus ( data not shown ) ( fig . 2â­4 ) . from previou genet analysi of the afm147-ma variant , all of the hkma mutat would be expect to be adapt ( 9 , 15 ) . parallel evolut associ with virul . three mutat ob- serv on mous adapt of HK occur at site of preexist variat in FM , which may repres adapt chang select on mous adapt in 1947 and is consist with the presenc of virul determin in thi viru ( 9 , 14 , 15 ) . ten of 14 site that mutat in hkma variant were also found to have mutat in other natur virul or laboratory-adapt strain ( data not shown ) . with respect to the virul ahk15697 strain , it is interest that thi viru possess three amino acid mutat , pb2-asp-7013asn , ns1-phe-1033leu , and ns2-lys-883arg , in parallel with HK MA variant , and suggest they may oper in thi viru to mediat it virul . the pb2-asp-7013asn muta- tion is locat between the second nuclear local signal ( nls2 ) at 736â­739 and the cap-bind motif at 634â­650 ( fig . 4 ; ref . 12 ) , both of which could be modifi in activ . the ns1 gene is requir for counteract sever antivir effect of ifn ( 20 ) , and so the phe-1033leu mutat may be affect thi function , becaus mice lack an ifn respons can develop a system infect with neurovirul influenza viru ( 20 ) that is similar to ahk15697 infect of wild-typ mice ( 6 ) . the remain mutat , ns2-lys-883arg , may be affect the function of thi protein in nuclear export of viral nucleocapsid ( 12 ) . sequenc analysi of ahk15697 clone that are attenu in virul for mice wa associ with the loss of the pb2-asp-7013asn mutat as well as two mutat , ns1-asp-1013asn and ha1- pro-2113thr , which are near the ns1â­103 and ha1â­218 muta- tion observ on mous adapt ( 21 ) , further support the relev of these mutat as determin of virul . fig . 4 . locat of mutat select on mous adapt on the func- tional genet map of influenza A viru . the locat of mutat seen in fm-ma that have been confirm to control virul ( 9 ) are shown with black downward arrow , and those preexist in FM viru are indic in blue . mutat observ in hkma clone are shown with upward arrow . the function region and bind site are describ elsewher ( 12 ) . nl , nuclear local signal ; pol , polymeras ; ntp , nucleotid triphosph ; pkr , dsrna-depend protein kinas ; effector indic a multipl protein- bind region ; ne , nuclear export signal ; region label with influenza viru protein name indic site of interact . brown et al . pna june 5 , 2001 vol . 98 no . 12 6887 microbiolog parallel mutat with human lineag of viru . two of the MA mutat had also been independ select in human . the ns1-val-233ala mutat is converg with most influenza virus , includ human h1n1 and h2n2 strain ( data not shown ) . the m1-thr-1673ala mutat wa also establish in the human h3n2 lineag in 1972 ( data not shown ) . thu , experiment evolut appear to recapitul the select process of natur evolut of influenza virus . MA variant possess mutat in specif function region . It is appar that increas virul is becaus of mutat that increas the abil of influenza viru to exploit the host envi- ronment . given the locat of mutat select on mous adapt in fm-ma and hkma variant ( fig . 4 ) , they appear to implic the central process of viral replic and site of interact with host and viral compon . specif type of function region that are repeatedli mutat includ rna- bind site , as seen for ns1â­23 , m1â­139 , and possibl np-34 ; nuclear local signal of polymeras subunit , pb2â­482 , and pa-133 , as well as mutat at subunit interfac of HA , ha1â­218 in hkma variant , and ha2â­47 in fm-ma ( tabl 4 ; ref . 14 ) . the np-480 mutat is adjac to amino acid 479 , which affect NP oligomer ( 12 ) , and the pb2-bind site of the pb1 polymeras subunit is mutat in fm-ma ( 9 , 12 ) . the thr-1563asn mutat of ha2 result in the loss of a glycosyl site adjac to the cleavag site of ha0 and may be relev to cleavag activ , becaus there is detect cleavag of HA without trypsin for the hkma-12 , 20 , and 20c strain produc in mdck cell ( fig . 1D ) . thi is analog to the loss of a glycosyl site near the cleavag site of the HA of ack pennsylvania137083 ( h5n2 ) , which result in increas cleav- abil and high virul ( 22 ) . the other HA mutat , gly- 2183w of ha1 , occur at the trimer interfac adjac to the receptor-bind site . mutat at thi site in monoclon antibodi escap mutant have been shown not onli to affect HA structur such that antibodi bind is maintain without neutral but concomitantli to result in alter in receptor specif and the pH threshold for membran fusion ( 19 ) . consist with these data , the hkma-12 , -20 , and -20c variant were alter in pH of fusion , resist to -inhibitor ( mous serum lectin ) , and receptor bind ( data not shown ) . A common featur of other MA variant is mutat in HA associ with resist to inhibitor and in some instanc alter pH of fusion , as seen for fm-ma and aphilippines282bsml10 ( 8 , 17 ) . extragen modul of HA function . the observ that the hkma-12 , 20 , and 20c strain had the same HA amino acid sequenc but were heterogen in their pH of fusion as well as resist to inhibitor indic that other mutat in the genom presum present on an interact protein were respons for modul the properti of HA ( fig . 4 ) . the M1 protein is a strong candid for thi novel role , becaus it differ in both hkma20 and hkma20c rel to hkma12 and ha been implic in the modul of HA function . strain of human influenza h1n1 virus with ident HA molecul differ in their abil to agglutin chick erythrocyt becaus of the natur of their M1 protein ( 23 ) . interestingli , fixat of the m1â­167 mutat in the human lineag in 1972 coincid with a chang in receptor specif ( 24 ) that did not correl with chang in HA sequenc , again suggest the involv of anoth protein in HA function . becaus there is direct evid that the M1 protein interact with the cyto- plasmic project of HA and NA ( 25 ) , it is possibl that the natur of thi interact affect HA biolog . the m2â­44 site , at the cytoplasm border of the transmem- brane domain ( fig . 4 ) , is also mutat in two highli virul avian strain , ackfpvrostock34 ( fpv ) ( h7n7 ) and ackpenn137083 ( h5n2 ) . previou studi have shown that the fpv M2 protein is requir to prevent prematur acid- induc conform chang of it HA in endosom ( 26 ) . reassort of ackpenn137083 that possess it HA gene invari possess it M1 and M2 gene ( 27 ) , suggest a function requir for anoth gene interact . host-restrict mutat . the natur of the polymeras , NP , and NS protein ha been implic in host restrict ( 12 ) . the hkma20c variant ha becom host restrict in it growth char- acterist , possibl becaus of the pa-133 mutat in the first nuclear local signal ( nls1 ) . the fm-ma variant ha the same growth properti becaus of a combin of mutat in the pb2 ( nls1 ) and pb1 ( pb2-bind site ) subunit ( 9 ) . the pa-556 mutat may also be relev to host specif , becaus thi site ha mutat onli in two other virus , both with a histori of mous adapt ( apr834 and aws33 ) . the NP gene ha evolv into host-specif lineag ( 12 ) , where asp-34 is found in all human clinic isol but ha mutat in hkma variant . In conclus , mous adapt is caus by select of host- depend as well as host-independ mutat that result in heighten exploit of the host , seen clinic as increas diseas . the mean of achiev optim competit advantag appear to be control by acquisit of a rel discret subset of mutat that involv specif type of function region of the influenza viru genom . the locat of these mutat identifi novel modul of virul . the adapt approach to analyz virul should have gener applic to other virus ( 11 ) . sequenc analysi wa initi in R. levandowski 's laboratori , offic of vaccin research and review , center for biolog evalu and research , feder drug administr . help critic wa provid by E.
