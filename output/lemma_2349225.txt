In addit , the presenc of oligosaccharid at specif site on the HA can determin how well the viru bind to certain cell ( 8 , 9 ) and how suscept the HA is to the proteolyt cleavag that is requir for the express of it fusion activ ( 10-12 ) . thu , chang in the amino acid sequenc ofth HA can alter viru host rang at the cellular level , and it ha been clearli shown that minor form within a viru popul will rapidli predomin if they have a growth advantag dure cultiv in the laboratori ( 2 , 8 , 13-17 ) . these observ have led to the concern that minor heterogen within clinic sampl or mutat that occur dure isol and growth could lead to laboratory-grown influenza viru popul that are significantli differ from those in the origin clinic sampl . were such selec- tion to occur dure growth of the viru in embryon chicken egg or in certain cultur cell , viru from those sourc would be poorli suit for the studi ofha function and for the prepar of vaccin . the studi present here were undertaken to determin the sequenc ofth HA gene directli from the viru within a clinic sampl so that nucleotid chang that might be associ with growth in laboratori host could be avoid . We have use the polymeras chain reaction ( pcr ; ref . 18 ) to amplifi dna made from viru recov from a patient with influenza and have determin the nucleotid sequenc ofth HA gene from it 3 ' end into the ha2 region . We have use the same procedur to determin the sequenc of thi region of the HA gene after growth ofthi isol in chicken embryo . the deduc amino acid sequenc are report hereâ§ and are compar to those of virus of the same subtyp isol sinc 1977 by growth in embryon egg . materi and method viru isol and growth . nasopharyng swab taken forth diagnosi offebril respiratori ill were use in thi studi . sampl were taken in januari of 1987 at cardin glennon children 's hospit ( saint loui , MO ) . viru iso- lation and identif were carri out use tube cultur of primari rhesu monkey kidney cell obtain from wh- itak m.a . bioproduct . swab that contain influenza viru were store at -700c in -2 ml of transport medium ( veal infus broth contain 0.5 % gelatin , penicillin , gen- tamicin , and amphotericin B ) .

B1 dna wa therefor purifi by gel electrophoresi and use for sequenc anal- ysi . To obtain inform about the sequenc at the cleavag site between ha1 and ha2 , we need dna copi that extend into the ha2 region . We therefor amplifi dna by use primer I and II ( see fig . 1 ) . sinc these primer are complementari to the conserv region at the two end of all genom segment ( 25-27 ) , they were expect to produc complet copi of all eight virion gene , albeit in small amount . To obtain a suffici amount of the HA dna for sequenc , we use these complet dna copi as tem- plate for reamplifl use two new ha-specif prim- er , iii and V. sinc we had alreadi determin the sequenc ofmost ofth plus-strand HA dna , one ofthes new primer ( iii ) wa design to be complementari to the first 35 nucleotid at the 3 ' end of the a/sl/2/87 HA gene . thi primer is ident to primer I for the first 12 nucleotid but contain 23 addit base that are specif for the sequenc found in a/sl/2/87 . primer iii , along with primer V , which is complementari to nucleotid 1095-1074 in the ha2 region of the ussr plu strand ( see fig . 1 ) , produc dna ofon size class . It migrat slightli slowerthan B1 dna and had the same ava I and ava II cleavag site as those in B1 dna ( result not shown ) . By sequenc both strand ofthi dna , we have determin the sequenc of the first 31 base of the ha2 region and have confirm the sequenc that we had previous obtain from B1 dna . the use of thi second method ofobtain amplifi dna ha increas the likelihood that our sequenc repres that of the major of the virus in the clinic sampl rather than the sequenc ofa minor popul that wa select amplifi by the primer use . the nucleic acid sequenc of a/sl/2/87 after a singl passag in egg wa also determin from dna obtain by pcr use primer iii and V. thi dna , like that obtain directli from the clinic sampl when these two primer were use , wa homogen in size and wa slightli larger than B1 dna . the nucleotid sequenc of thi dna wa ident to that obtain from viru taken directli from the throat . the nucleotid sequenc of a/sl/2/87 and that of em- bryonat egg-grown a/tw/1/86 ( kindli provid by nanci cox , center for diseas control , atlanta ) are highli similar . differ were observ at seven posit ( cy- tosin in a/tw/1/86 versu uracil in a/sl/2/87 at nucle- otid 251 , 371 , 848 , and 1001 ; guanin versu adenin at nucleotid 748 and 793 ; and adenin versu guanin at nucleotid 1021 ) . four of these differ ( at residu 251 , 371 , 848 , and 1001 ) are in the third nucleotid of the codon and do not chang the amino acid specifi by the sequenc . the remain three ( at nucleotid 748 , 793 , and 1021 ) chang the amino acid at posit 225 , 240 , and 315 as indic in fig . 3 . howev , two independ report ofth amino acid sequenc ofa/tw/1/86 have been publish ( 30 , 31 ) ; they differ at amino acid 138 , 240 , and 315 . As indic in fig . 3 , the sequenc ofa/sl/2/87 differ from both ofth publish sequenc ofa/tw/1/86 by onli one amino acid ; aspart acid ( D ) is found at posit 225 in both nasopha- ryngeal and egg-grown a/sl/2/87 , wherea glycin ( G ) is found in egg-grown a/tw/1/86 . both of these recent H1 isol differ significantli from a/ussr/77 . discuss although interest in influenza viru epidemiolog and genet- ic ha led to numer report concern the amino acid sequenc ofth HA gene , all previous report sequenc 1 10 20 a/ussr/77 mkakllvllcalsatdadtici yhc A istya a/tw/1/86 -- -- -- - FT -- -- -- -- -- -- - aisli2/87 -- -- -- -- -- -ft -- -- -- - - -- - __ 30 40 50 * dtvdtvlek ntthsvnlledshn6klcrlkgiap 60 70 * 80 90 L ( lgkcn iagwi lgnpeceslfskkswsyiaetpn IN - S - * 100 110 120 *** E ngtcyp GY fadyeelr eql S VS S F ER FE I fpker -_-__ S _- -- -_ _ _ -- -- -- - S 130 * 140 150 160 swpk~jnvt7rgvtascshkgkssfyrnllwlt 6 - - -si -- K -- - -s/a- -- -- -- -- -- -- - - - - -- - 170 180 190 ypnl fiksyvnnkekevlvlwgvhhpsniedoktiyr __ ___i -- -- -- -- -- -- G -- -- -- -- RA -- H 200 210 220 230 kenayvsvvssnynrrftpeiaerpkvrguagrini T- -- -- -- -- -H -- -- -- -- -k- -- -- -- E -- -- - T -- -- -- H -- -- -- K -- -d-e -- - 240 250 260 * ywtllepgdtiifeangnliapuhafalnrgfgsgi -gi -- 6E -- -- -- -- Y -- -- S -- -- -- -- E -- -- -- -- Y -- -- S -- -- 270 280 290 300 IT S MD ecdtkcatp ( gair7zilp F ( nihp VT IG ___ __ -- -- - A -________ -- - - - -- -- V- -- -- - -_ -___- -- -- -A -- -- -- -- -- ____ -i- -- -- V- -- -- - V 310 320 330 ecpkyvrstklrmvtglrnipsiqsrglfgaiagfi -- -- -- -- -- -k/r -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -R -- -- -- -_________________ fig . 3 . amino acid sequenc of the ha1 subunit and the ha1/ ha2 cleavag region of nasopharyng and egg-grown a/sl/2/87 and oftwo egg-grown H1 strain , a/ussr/77 and a/tw/1/86 . the amino acid are number to correspond to those in the H3 HA as previous describ ( 28 ) . amino acid present in the H1 subtyp but not in H3 are mark by star . the glycosyl site are indic by box . dash indic no differ in sequenc from that found in a/ussr/77 ( 29 ) . for a/tw/1/86 , two amino acid are given at three posit . the amino acid abov the bar is that found by cox etal .

A singl sequenc is shown for a/sl/2/87 , sinc nasopharyng and egg- grown viru gave ident sequenc . proc . natl . acad . sci . usa 87 ( 1990 ) proc . natl . acad . sci . usa 87 ( 1990 ) 4157 have been deriv from viru strain that had been grown either in egg or in cultur cell . our approach use the pcr to amplifi copi of the HA gene ha enabl us to determin the sequenc of thi viral gene start with the limit amount of viru that can be recov from a na- sopharyng swab taken dure the acut stage ofil . In so do we have been abl to determin the sequenc ofthi viral surfac glycoprotein without there have been oppor- tuniti for select ofvari form dure viru cultiv in egg or in cell cultur . We have found that the HA gene sequenc encompass the ha1 region and the ha1/ha2 cleavag region ofa 1987 isol is ident when obtain directli from viru in the nasopharynx and from viru grown in chicken embryo . furthermor , thi sequenc is strikingli similar to those of other H1 virus isol in 1986 . In fact , the onli differ between a/sl/2/87 and a/tw/1/86 is the presenc of aspart acid instead ofglycin at amino acid 225 . By analog to the H3 HA ( 32 ) , thi amino acid is locat on the rim ofth receptor bind pocket and might be expect to influenc the specif or the affin ofth HA for receptor on host cell from differ sourc . It ha , in fact , been propos that an aspart acid to glycin substitut occur dure adapt ofh1 virus to growthin egg ( 33 ) . thi is not the case with the isol describ here , sinc aspart acid remain at posit 225 when a/sl/2/87 is grown for one passag in egg . In addit , of some 19 H1 virus isol sinc 1977 and sequenc after a limit number ofpassag in egg , 8 have aspart acid , 8 have glycin , and 3 have asparagin at posit 225 ( 30 , 31 , 33 , 34 ) , indic that all three of these amino acid are compat with growth ofh1 strain in egg . thu , the sequenc data present here from dna synthes by pcr are consist with those obtain previous from egg-grown H1 isol . the accumul evid indic that embryon egg do not provid a strong select pressur for an aspart acid to glycin substitut at amino acid 225 . whether thi chang will occur dure long-term passag of a/sl/2/87 in egg or in cultur mammalian cell and whether other amino acid substitut will accompani it can now be determin . As indic in fig . 3 , glutamin ha been found at posit 226 in a/sl/2/87 and in the two refer strain . thi amino acid is also on the rim of the receptor bind pocket and ha been implic in determin the receptor speci- ficiti of H3 strain ( 4 ) . with H3 strain , glutamin at amino acid 226 ha been found in viru obtain from avian sourc wherea leucin ha been found at that posit in viru of human and equin origin ( 35 ) . thi is not the case with H1 strain ; glutamin ha been found at posit 226 in all human isol grown in egg or cultur cell and , as shown here , in viru obtain directli from the human nasopharynx . the glycosyl site on the H1 virus isol sinc 1977 have been highli conserv . As shown in fig . 3 , a/ussr/77 ha eight site wherea a/tw/86 ha nine . except for the addit glycosyl site at amino acid 63 of the ha1 subunit and the shift of the site from 131 to 129 in the 1986 isol ( 30 , 31 ) , the H1 strain isol sinc 1977 have ident glycosyl site . sinc these same glyco- sylat site are found in viru taken directli from the nasopharynx , neither addit nor delet of glycosyl site can be attribut to growth of these virus in the laboratori . It remain to be determin , howev , whether all ofthes site will be maintain through extens passag of these virus in egg or in cell cultur . It is interest in thi regard that the strain of influenza viru that have been grown in the laboratori for mani year have function ha1 subunit with as few as four glycosyl site , onli two of which ( those at amino acid 20/21 and 271 ) are conserv in all strain . In the case of the wsn strain , delet of a glycosyl site from the tip of the HA actual enhanc growth ofth viru in some mammalian cell ( 8 , 9 ) , and with an influenza B strain , viru isol in egg lack a glycosyl- ation site that is present on viru isol from the same sourc in madin-darbi canin kidney cell ( 16 ) . sinc de- letion ofglycosyl site is clearli toler dure growth of these virus in cell cultur , their conserv among new isol suggest that the oligosaccharid at these site are critic to the surviv of these strain in natur , rather than to the receptor-bind or fusion activ of the HA . these consider strengthen the previous made pro- posal that the oligosaccharid may mask antigen site ( 36 ) that would otherwis contribut to immun surveil and reduc viru transmiss within the human popul . It is import to point out that the inform present here should not be taken to indic that the viru popul within the nasopharynx is homogen with respect to it HA sequenc . minor heterogen in the HA gene would not be detect by the techniqu use here . sinc we have sequenc the HA gene directli from amplifi dna pool obtain by two differ procedur , we have reduc the chanc of see random substitut that could be intro- duce into the sequenc by the taq polymeras . howev , thi approach also reduc the possibl of detect minor compon within a heterogen popul . thu , the deduc amino acid sequenc we have obtain is that ofth major compon within the clinic sampl , and other approach are need to determin whether these popula- tion are heterogen in HA sequenc . sinc onli low amount ofviru are need for sequenc by the techniqu use here , variou question relat to the viru popul within a clinic sampl can now be inves- tigat . for exampl , will viru from other individu in- fect within the same epidem show exactli the same sequenc as that report here , or will the major compon found within a clinic sampl depend in part on the immun state of the patient ? will there be ani chang in HA sequenc dure the progress of the diseas ? will pro- long passag in differ laboratori host produc differ popul from thi isol and , ifso , is thi due to mutat and select dure cultiv in the laboratori or to select of differ minor compon within the clinic sampl ? with respect to these two altern , previou work indic that both process occur . On the one hand , mutant with singl base substitut in the HA gene have beenfound to aris in homogen popul deriv from singl plaqu and to replac the origin viru strain when the mutant ha a select advantag over the parent in the cell cultur use for viru propag ( 8 , 9 ) . On the other , viru popul obtain directli from patient with influ- enza have been resolv into subpopul that differ from one anoth by as littl as a singl amino acid ( 17 , 33 , 35-37 ) . the inform present here indic that growth of new isol for a limit number ofpassag in embryon egg can be expect to provid H1 stock with hal se- quenc that faith repres those found on virion within the nasopharynx . whether thi is the case with other influenza A subtyp and influenza B virus can now be determin use the approach employ here . thi ap- proach should also be use in vaccin develop and evalu ; it should help to ensur that the viru strain that are incorpor into influenza vaccin have ha that mirror those found in the human popul . lastli , the incomplet dna in the amplifi pool ob- tain from the clinic sampl need to be investig . As indic abov , these smaller dna have been obtain from both ofth clinic isol that we have examin . with a/sl/2/87 they were seen with viru obtain directli from the nasopharynx and from chicken embryo-grown viru when primer I and IV were use dure amplif ( data not shown ) , but not when primer iii and V were use . they biochemistri : rajakumar et al . 4158 biochemistri : rajakumar et al . were not observ when plaque-isol viru of the wsn strain wa amplifi use primer I and IV . these dna may be gener dure amplif as a consequ of some as yet unidentifi variat or imperfect in the pcr . howev , the condit under which they are found are consist with their be authent dna copi of defect HA genom segment .
