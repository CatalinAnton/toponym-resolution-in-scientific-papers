A comparison of the code and noncod mutat in the mammalian and avian lineag show a significantli lower ratio of code to total nucleotid chang in the avian virus . addit , the avian viru lineag of both the H3 and H4 serotyp , but not the mammalian viru lineag , show significantli greater conserv of amino acid sequenc in the intern branch of the phylogenet tree than in the termin branch . the small number of amino acid differ between the avian virus and the progenitor of the 1968 pandem strain and the great phenotyp stabil of the avian virus suggest that strain similar to the progenitor strain will continu to circul in bird and will be avail for reintroduct into human . influenza virus of the H3 serotyp appear in human and caus a major pandem in 1968 . subsequ , it wa found that antigen relat virus had been present in duck and hors for a minimum of 5 year earlier ( 27 ) . It is now known that H3 serotyp virus are wide distribut in waterfowl and have also been associ with occasion outbreak of swine influenza . serolog archaeolog studi have suggest that antigen relat virus circul in human dure the 1890 , lead to the hypothesi that thi and other serotyp may period recycl through the human popul ( 28 ) . previou studi with isol of the human H3 virus ( 5 , 6 , 14 , 43 ) show the progress accumul of mutat in the preval circul strain and correl these mutat with the progress antigen chang seen in the human strain . antigen character of h3n2 swine influenza virus isol ( 40 , 41 ) suggest that these vi- ruse had been deriv from earli human h3n2 virus and had maintain antigen characterist that had been lost in later human viru isol . kida et al . ( 24 , 25 ) analyz a seri of asian avian and swine virus and found some of the avian H3 hemagglutinin close relat to both the swine and human h3n2 virus . the interrelationship of the H3 * correspond author . equin influenza virus have been studi by daniel et al . ( 10 ) and kawaoka et al . ( 22 ) . We initi thi studi to defin the detail evolutionari relationship among the H3 influenza virus , to determin the mutat characterist of the viru in differ host , and to investig the characterist of the viru strain propos to be the progenitor of the human pandem strain . materi and method viru strain and nucleic acid sequenc . the nucleic acid sequenc of 40 HA gene from influenza virus of the H3 serotyp and 9 of the H4 serotyp were analyz in thi studi . the sourc of the viru isol sequenc are sum- mariz in tabl 1 . those not previous publish were obtain from the repositori ofst . jude children 's research hospit . viru wa grown and purifi , and virion rna wa prepar as describ previous ( 3 ) . sequenc wa either directli from virion rna as describ previous ( 4 ) or from full-length clone in the patx vector as describ by kawaoka et al .

( 11 ) a the publish sequenc report onli the sequenc code for the matur polypeptid . the sequenc of the signal peptid region wa determin from viral rna as describ in materi and method . phylogenet analysi . phylogenet analysi wa primarili perform by use the program paup ( phylogenet anal- ysi use parsimoni ) , version 2.4 ( david L. swofford , illinoi natur histori survey , champaign , ill. ) . search for the most parsimoni topolog for the nucleotid and amino acid sequenc of the entir data set ( 49 taxa ) were done use the mulpar and global swap option . de- tail studi of specifi region of the tree to determin optim and altern topolog were done by use the branch and bound algorithm with the bbsave option . phylogenet analys of the nucleic acid sequenc in which code substitut were weight more heavili than non- code chang wa done by append each amino acid sequenc to it nucleotid sequenc and submit the combin sequenc to maximum parsimoni analysi . thi effect doubl the weight of each code substitut . greater weight for the code chang were obtain by appli the weight option of paup to the charact repres the append amino acid . hypothet ances- tral sequenc were gener as describ by fitch ( 13 ) . statist analysi . the amino acid chang to nucleotid chang ratio wa estim for the intern and termin J. virol . evolut OF the influenza viru H3 hemagglutinin 1131 branch of the phylogenet tree for the differ host speci by regress amino acid chang on nucleotid chang . becaus the varianc of amino acid chang for a given branch is proport to nucleotid chang ( binomi theori ) , the data were weight by 1/nucleotid chang , which is a standard method for assign weight . differ- enc in the mutat rate of the hal and ha2 domain for differ lineag were assess by use the chi-squar test . nucleotid sequenc access number . the nucleotid sequenc for the strain not previous publish are avail- abl from genbank under access number m73771 through m73776 . result the deduc amino acid sequenc for the entir code region of the hemagglutinin of the 40 H3 influenza viru strain and that of a hypothet avian viru ancestor are shown in fig . 1 . the 13 equin viru isol are 1 amino acid shorter than those from other speci , and the align use by daniel et al . ( 10 ) is shown . Of the 566 amino acid , 351 are invari , and 68 other are invari in all except one of the isol . the most conserv of the amino acid is tryptophan . Of the 12 tryptophan in the sequenc of the ancestr avian viru , 10 are invari , follow by tyrosin ( 16 of 20 ) , methionin ( 7 of 9 ) , histidin ( 8 of 11 ) , and cystein ( 13 of 18 ) . these five conserv amino acid are also among the least abund . the least conserv amino acid is valin . Of 33 valin in the ancestr sequenc , 14 are invari . for the estim of evolutionari relationship among the viru isol , onli the nucleotid sequenc of the code region ( nucleotid 30 to 1730 ) wa use in thi analysi , becaus the sequenc of the noncod 3 ' and 5 ' end , although highli conserv where they are known , are not avail for mani of the strain studi . insert and delet of codon were record for thi analysi to assum that each occur as a singl mutat event rather than as three mutat . the H4 hemagglutinin wa previous shown by air ( 1 ) to be more close relat to the H3 hemagglutinin than that of ani of the other subtyp . therefor , nine H4 influenza viru gene sequenc were includ in these analys as an outgroup to provid a hypothet origin for the H3 lineag and to provid further inform on the genet conserv of the avian virus . their align with the H3 sequenc is that use by doni et al . ( 11 ) . the shortest path connect the 49 nucleotid sequenc requir 2,817 step . thi pathway split the H3 taxa into three major lineag : one contain onli avian virus ; one contain avian , human , and swine viru isol ; and one contain all of the equin viru isol . sever ap- proach were use to test the robust of the topolog . sinc the number of taxa wa too great to allow an exhaus- tive search of all possibl topolog , altern topolog and shorter path were search for by ' reanalyz the data after divid the tree into major section . the data set wa also analyz by use the amino acid sequenc . thi result in a tree with the same gener topolog as the tree base on the nucleic acid sequenc , but the presenc of sever short and zero-length intern branch connect the avian viru isol result in a larg number ( > 50 ) of equal parsimoni solut . thi problem wa elimi- nate by includ the entir rna sequenc and appli greater weight to the code chang . thi allow the junction affect by amino acid chang to be studi while preserv those support onli by silent mutat . the code chang support a phylogenet tree differ from that support by all nucleotid chang at two ofth branch point . these are label A and B in fig . 2 and are detail in fig . 3 . one of these ( node B ) significantli affect the interpret origin of the equin lineag and is discuss below . the other ha a minor effect on the asian avian lineag near the origin of the human viru but doe not affect the interpret of the avian-human viru junction . the onli other signific ambigu wa at the join of the two 1968 human viru strain ( aichi and nt/60 ) with the rest of the tree . In the topolog shown , a 3-nucleotid , 0-amino-acid branch join these two strain with the trunk of the tree . An equal parsimoni solut branch each separ from the same point on the trunk . analysi of the H3 nucleotid data use the neighbor join method ( 36 ) gave a topolog nearli ident to that obtain when all nucle- otid were use with the maximum parsimoni method . the onli differ wa that swine/ukkel/84 branch from the main trunk immedi befor the branch contain vic/75 and swine/col/77 , rather than immedi after thi branch . the signific of thi differ is not known . the remark featur of the phylogenet tree are the close linkag of the human viru lineag to the avian virus , the rapid diverg of the human virus from their origin , the great separ of the equin virus from those of other speci , and the strong conserv of the amino acid sequenc in the avian lineag . analysi of the avian-human junction . the phylogenet tree indic that the human viru of the h3n2 serotyp origin from a lineag close relat to a seri of avian viru isol from asia describ by kida et al . ( 24 ) . To identifi the chang that occur in thi viru dure it transit from an avian pathogen to a human pandem strain , the hypothet ancestr sequenc of the last avian and first human strain ( fig . 2 , node A and C ) were determin ( 13 ) and their differ were studi in detail . the transit requir 13 nucleic acid chang , 7 of which affect the amino acid sequenc . the locat of these chang are shown in fig . 1 . one chang is not part of the matur protein but is at a highli variabl site in the signal peptid ; the other are all in the hal peptid and in the head of the molecul . these locat are detail in fig . 4 , and their signific is discuss below . rate of accumul of mutat . the mutat rate of the human sublineag wa estim by plot the year of isol against the evolutionari path distanc from node A to each isol ( fig . 5 , top ) . regress analysi gave mutat rate of 7.9 nucleotid and 3.4 amino acid per year for the code region ( 1,701 nucleotid , 566 amino acid ) . two swine influenza viru isol deriv from the human viru lineag ( swine/col/1/77 and swine/ukkel/84 ) were includ in these calcul , but the calcul mutat rate is not significantli affect when they are exclud . extrapol of the nucleotid regress line give date of 1967 and 1965 for node C and A , respect . similar analysi of the equin viru lineag ( fig . 5 , bot- tom ) give substitut rate of 3.1 nucleotid and 0.8 amino acid per year . the date of origin for the lineag ( node D , fig . 2 ) , extrapol from the nucleotid regress , is 1952 . the approxim linear relationship between the number of mutat and the isol date is valid for the topolog shown in fig . 2 but not for the altern topolog ( fig . 3 , top right ) . with the altern topolog , the 1971 and 1972 isol are farther from the origin ( node B ) than are the 1986 strain , and the four earliest isol appear to form a vol . 66 , 1992 1132 bean ET AL .

( bottom ) four avian taxa near the avian-human junction ( fig . 2 , node A ) . the join on the right requir three addit nucleotid substitut but one less amino acid substitut . the topolog on the left wa use in fig . 1 . thi studi wa initi to defin the sourc and charac- terist of the progenitor of the hemagglutinin of the current H3 human virus and to provid a better understand of the genet interrelationship and mutat constraint of the viru strain in differ host . the H3 hemagglutinin phylogeni calcul from the sequenc data clearli show that there is a remark close relationship among the first human H3 virus and some of the viru strain still circu- late in avian speci . the result indic that the human hemagglutinin gene wa veri recent introduc into the viru infect human and that it underw onli a few mutat in it transit from an avian viru to a human pandem strain . one of these mutat ( posit 226 ) ha been previous implic in host specif ( 30 ) .

Of the four swine viru isol includ in thi analysi , two were introduc into swine from the human viru lineag and two are recent introduct from avian virus . thi find and previou evid for the transmiss of viru between bird and swine ( 19 , 34 ) , as well as document transmiss of influenza viru from swine to human ( 18 , 35 ) , leav open the possibl that a swine intermedi could have been involv . the ratio of the code chang to mutat in the four swine viru isol includ in thi studi were similar to those of the human strain . thu , the data are consist with a transfer of the hemagglutinin from the avian reservoir into swine at node C and then into human at node A . regardless of the initi mammalian host , if the amino acid substitut dure thi period were select by antibodi pressur , the viru is like to have been the human nucleotid 150 amino acid _ 100 0- to o50 U ._a 0 S E 0 0 0 0 100 0 z 50 190 1950 7.9 substitutionslyear 3.4 substitutionslyear 1960 1970 1980 1990 year of isol fig . 5 . rate of accumul of nucleotid and amino acid chang in the human and equin virus . rate were calcul by the regress of the date of isol and the total branch distanc from node A and B for the human and equin viru isol , respect ( fig . 2 ) . the amino acid and nucleotid distanc are plot as open and close circl , respect . predomin strain in a popul , suffici larg to have maintain the viru but limit enough to have escap detect .

If surviv favor those that have not chang , then viru popul in environ that undergo rela- tive few replic cycl would be more like to yield progeni that do not have deleteri mutat . those replic in other environ or mutant in the origin popul might have a temporari select advantag in a particular host or environ , but the accumul of mutat in these subpopul would be deleteri in other circumst . thu , the origin popul ( perhap often in a veri small minor ) would have a select advantag as host or environment condit chang . the strike differ in the topolog of the H3 and H4 avian lineag in comparison with the human viru lineag is appar due to a heavi posit select pressur on virus replic in human that is not seen when replicat- ing in bird . fitch et al . ( 14 ) have studi the unusu '' cactuslik '' topolog of the human influenza A virus and have shown that the proport of amino acid chang affect antigen region of the hemagglutinin ( ha1 ) is greater on the main trunk than on the side branch of the tree . thi provid convinc evid for posit darwin- ian select on the hal molecul , mediat by immun pressur . they calcul the age of the nonsurviv side branch ( the distanc from the main lineag trunk to the branch tip ) to be 1.6 year . the present studi , use a veri differ data set and the entir code sequenc , give a veri similar valu of 1.5 year . the increas mutat rate seen in the hemagglutinin when transfer from an avian to a mammalian host is parallel by smaller increas in the mutat rate of other gene ( 9 , 14 , 16 ) . the topolog of the avian viru lineag resembl that describ for the human influenza C viru ( 7 , 8 , 47 ) , with multipl cocircul lineag and littl correl between tree posit and date of isol . In both case thi may reflect a long-establish equilibrium between the viru and the host . the influenza B virus show a regular relationship between tree posit and isol date but a slower rate of i i I z a ! 8 :1 a -1 I evolut OF the influenza viru H3 hemagglutinin 1137 chang than the human influenza A strain and cocircul branch that surviv much longer than the short side branch of the influenza A virus ( 14 , 47 ) . air et al . ( 2 ) have analyz the proport of silent and nonsil muta- tion in the human A and B virus and have propos that the evolut of the B virus is not primarili driven by immun select . In the present studi , the onli intern avian branch with a larg proport of code chang on the phylogenet tree are the long link connect the H3 equin virus and the H4 's with the rest of the taxa . howev , these length and their connect point to each other must be interpret with caution . the larg number of silent mutat , particu- larli in the link to the H4 virus , make it like that the total number of mutat is underestim , sinc ani of them could have mutat multipl time . lack evolutionari intermedi and with no inform on what select pressur or time period were involv in the separ of the HA subtyp , we can not estim the actual length of these branch with ani certainti . the stabil of the avian strain suggest that the viru ha reach an adapt optimum in bird that ha not been achiev in human . there are sever possibl explan for thi differ . one obviou possibl is that becaus thi gene wa onli recent introduc into the human viru , it ha not had time to reach an optim configur . anoth possibl is that when the viru is in human there is suffici flexibl in the interact of the hemagglutinin with the host that no singl configur is optim and that mutat select by antibodi may not significantli affect other properti or function of the protein . thi impli that in an immunolog naiv popul , the virus deriv by continu immunolog select would not be at a select disadvantag if place in competit with the origin strain . A third possibl , and perhap the most like , is that the H3 hemagglutinin wa alreadi in it optim configur after it initi adapt as a human patho- gen . subsequ mutat in respons to antibodi pres- sure in the human popul , while essenti for the continu surviv of the viru lineag , would put the viru at a disadvantag ifforc to compet with the origin strain in an immunolog naiv popul . thi question re- main to be test directli but is consist with the ob- serv period replac of influenza viru strain in the human popul with anoth serotyp and the hypothe- size recycl ofinfluenza viru strain ( 28 ) . If the recycl of influenza viru serotyp is to occur , it requir a mech- anism for maintain the viru while it is not circul in human , and the avian viru reservoir clearli provid one . the highli conserv phenotyp of the H3 hemagglutinin in bird suggest that strain veri similar to the progenitor of the 1968 pandem will continu to circul in bird and will be avail for reintroduct into mammalian host in the futur . acknowledg We thank raphael onwuzuruigbo and evelyn stigger for techni- cal assist . thi work wa support by public health servic grant al- 20591 , ai-08831 , ai-29680 , ai-29599 , and ai-27497 from the na- tional institut of allergi and infecti diseas , by cancer center support grant ( core ) ca-21765 , and by the american lebanes syrian associ chariti . refer 1 . air , G.
