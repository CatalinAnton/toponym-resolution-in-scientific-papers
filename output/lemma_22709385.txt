On decemb 31 , 2010 , a 3-year-old boy in rural jiangsu provinc , peopl 's republ of china , who had chronic renal diseas ( for which he wa given long-term steroid treatment ) , sought care with influenza- like symptom . laboratori test at the chines center for diseas control and prevent yield a posit result for european avian-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv , indic that the european avian-lik siv also caus human infect in the asia-pacif region . the studi after notif of the boy 's infect from the ministri of health , we perform activ public health surveil to locat the origin of the infect . A total of 60 nasal swab specimen were collect from pig at the patient 's famili farm and a local slaughterhous . each swab wa place in 2 mL of minim essenti medium supplement with penicillin ( 2,000 u/ml ) and streptomycin ( 2,000 u/ml ) . viru wa isol by use 10-day-old specif pathogen-fre embryon chicken egg . hemagglutinin ( HA ) and neuraminidas ( NA ) subtyp were determin as describ ( 5 ) . three A ( h1n1 ) siv were obtain , includ 2 isol from pig in the slaughterhous and 1 from a pig rais at the famili 's farm . viral rna wa extract and revers transcrib under standard condit by use the uni12 ( 5-agcaaaagcagg-3 ) primer . the viral genom were amplifi by pcr and sequenc by use segment- specif primer ( sequenc avail on request ) . genom sequenc ultim show that the 3 isol were virtual ident , and the sequenc of the entir genom of the repres strain a/swine/jiangsu/40/2011 ( sw/js/40/11 ) is avail in genbank ( access no . jq319645â­jq319652 ) . unroot phylogenet tree were gener by use mega5 softwar ( www.megasoftwar . net ) . the A ( h1n1 ) virus isol in thi studi fell into the european avian-lik swine A ( h1n1 ) lineag ( figur 1 ) . the homolog of the polymeras basic protein ( PB ) 2 , pb1 , polymeras acid protein , HA , nucleocapsid protein , NA , matrix ( M ) , and nonstructur protein gene between the sw/js/40/11 viru and the a/jiangsu/1/2011 ( js/1/11 ) viru , which wa isol from the child , were 99.3 % , 99.3 % , 99.3 % , 99.7 % , 99.7 % , 99.4 % , 99.6 % , and 99.1 % , respect , indic that they might have been deriv from the same ancestor . the receptor-bind properti of the HA protein is a major molecular determin of host rang . the amino acid at site 190 and 225 of HA are major determin of the receptor-bind specif of the A ( h1n1 ) viru , and the mutat e190d and d225e in HA switch the viru receptor-bind specif from -2,3â­link sialosid to -2,6â­link sialosid ( 6 ) . the sw/js/40/11 and js/1/11 isol have the amino acid D at site 190 and E at site 225 within the HA protein , which impli that these virus might preferenti bind to -2,6â­link sialosid . potenti glycosyl site ( pgss ) also have a major effect on the antigen and receptor-bind properti of influenza A virus . molecular analysi show that the 2 jiangsu strain had 5 pgss in their ha1 protein , 4 of which were the same as those of the a/netherlands/386/1986 viru ( the caus of the first avian-lik siv infect in a human ) . antigen site in the H1 ha , i.e. , Sa , Sb , ca1 , ca2 , and Cb , were compar between a/netherlands/386/1986 and js/1/11 . amino acid mutat h159n , k238r , and g239e were observ at the ca2 site ; r187g at the ca1 site ; and t202d , n203 , s207t , and a212n at the Sb site . compar with js/1/11 , the uniqu mutat d204v , locat at the Sb site , which is an antigen site near the receptor-bind site in influenza viru ( 7 ) , occur in the ha1 of sw/js/40/11 ( figur 2 ) . No oseltamivir resistanceâ­conf substitut ( h274i and n294 ) were observ in the NA protein of the 2 virus , which suggest that they are sensit to NA inhibitor ( 8 ) . the amino acid sequenc of the M2 protein of the 2 isol did not contain the i27t or s31n substitut , characterist dispatch 1144 emerg infecti diseas Â· www.cdc.gov/eid Â· vol . 18 , No . 7 , juli 2012 1 these author contribut equal to thi articl . author affili : state key laboratori of veterinari biotechnologyâ­ harbin veterinari research institut , harbin , peopl 's republ of china doi : http : //dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid1807.120009 avian-lik influenza A ( h1n1 ) virus of amantadin resist in influenza virus ( 9,10 ) . the 627k and 701n residu in the pb2 protein contribut to the replic and transmiss of avian influenza virus in mammalian host ( 11â­14 ) . similar to most avian-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv , both isol ( js/1/11 and sw/js/40/11 ) had 701n in their pb2 gene . chicken antiserum against differ subtyp h1n1 or h1n2 siv were use for antigen analysi . the sw/ js/40/11 viru react with the antiserum against the classic A ( h1n1 ) siv ( a/swine/guangdong/6/2010 ) , the tripl reassort A ( h1n2 ) siv ( a/swine/tianjin/1/2007 ) , influenza A ( h1n1 ) pdm09 ( a/swine/heilongjiang/44/2009 ) , and the avian-lik siv ( a/swine/henan/11/2005 ) ( tabl ) , but not with the antiserum against the human-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv ( a/swine/hebei/15/2009 ) . antiserum against sw/ js/40/11 react onli with the avian-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv and the human-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv , but the HI titer against the human-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv were 4-fold lower than those against the avian-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv . these result suggest that the H1 subtyp siv circul in china differ antigen . We investig antibodi respons in 20 serum sampl from pig at the patient 's famili farm and the local slaughterhous . serolog assay show that the seropreval of antibodi to the avian-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv wa 55 % and to classic A ( h1n1 ) siv and A ( h1n1 ) pdm09 viru were 25 % and 30 % , respect . furthermor , antibodi against A ( h3n2 ) siv were observ but at the low rate of 10 % . conclus We show that similar virus were simultan preval in a local pig popul when a child wa infect with an avian-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv . specif , isol of avian-lik siv from a famili farm provid direct evid for the origin of the human infect . No further spread of the sw/js/40/2011-like swine strain occur , accord to the limit inform avail ; howev , the incid arous interest in influenza in anim , especi in pig . antigen analysi show that thi avian-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv wa antigen diverg from classic A ( h1n1 ) and human-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv current circul in china , which wa further reinforc by the heterogen of their genet relationship . sinc earli avian-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv isol in human , amino acid mutat in the antigen site and pg chang might have alter the antigen properti in the avian-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv cluster . our data highlight the need to character circul strain antigen and genet through regular influenza viru surveil . pig can serv as intermedi host for influenza virus to evolv toward effici replic in human . the classic A ( h1n1 ) siv and european avian-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv have circul worldwid in pig sinc 1930 and 1979 , respect , and a classic A ( h1n1 ) siv emerg in human as a tripl reassort , caus the 2009 influenza pandem ( 15 ) . although the virul and transmiss of the avian-lik A ( h1n1 ) siv remain emerg infecti diseas Â· www.cdc.gov/eid Â· vol . 18 , No . 7 , juli 2012 1145 figur 1 . phylogenet tree of select swine , human , and avian H1 hemagglutinin 1 sequenc .
