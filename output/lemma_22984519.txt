A prerequisit of public health plan to reduc global diseas burden from ari is to examin data on it epidemiolog in order to better defin environment factor as well as target popul for prevent intervent [ 4 ] . respiratori virus are predomin caus of ari , and the epidemiolog of acut viral respiratori ill in develop countri with temper climat ha been well-character [ 5â­ 7 ] . In countri such as the unit state , children have been shown to carri a larg burden of viral respiratori diseas [ 5 ] . recent prospect studi , which util more sensit method for detect respiratori virus such as multiplex polymeras chain reaction ( pcr ) , have similarli demonstr that the highest rate of viral respiratori infect occur among children and the frequenc of infect tend to decreas with age due to increas acquir immun [ 8 ] . respiratori syncyti viru ( rsv ) , in- fluenza viru , parainfluenza viru , and rhinoviru have long been identifi as common caus of ari [ 9 ] . recent improv in molecular detect techniqu have allow the identif of multipl new respiratori virus such as human metapneumoviru ( hmpv ) , human bocaviru ( hbov ) and human coronaviru nl63 plo one | www.plosone.org 1 septemb 2012 | volum 7 | issu 9 | e44511 [ 8 ] . while the bodi of literatur describ the epidemiolog of acut viral respiratori diseas in develop countri ha rapidli expand , knowledg of the distribut of these diseas in region such as tropic south america remain limit . influenza virus are among the most impact acut re- spiratori pathogen in term of morbid and mortal . despit develop public health intervent program , the estim annual averag number of influenza-rel hospit in the unit state exce 200,000 , and 36,000 death are attribut to influenza infect yearli [ 10,11 ] . inform on the contribut of influenza virus to the global burden of diseas due to acut respiratori ill is incomplet . data on the epidemiolog of influenza virus in develop countri are deriv from multipl sourc to includ laboratory-bas surveil , sentinel surveil , as well as hospit and outpati record . In develop countri , where resourc are spars , sentinel surveil method may be more readili access and more cost-effect than laboratory-bas or population-bas surveil for determin the viral etiolog of influenza-lik ill ( ili ) in these region . better identif of the viral caus of ili will enabl clinician in resource-limit set to appropri treat and manag patient ; more importantli , it will allow public health offici to formul more effect prevent and control strategi , includ monitor of influenza vaccin efficaci in their commun [ 12 ] . studi on the epidemiolog of ili in the tropic south and central american countri of peru , brazil , ecuador , nicaragua , hondura , and El salvador have been publish [ 13â­16 ] . A prospect studi of adult with ili in sao paulo , brazil , reveal that while influenza virus were the predomin caus of ili , rhinovirus and other respiratori virus were detect in 19.6 % and 13.7 % of subject , respect [ 14 ] . thi observ illustr that a signific proport of patient who are clinic diagnos with influenza viru infect may have symptom indistinguish from other respiratori virus . In a prospect studi of ili in ecuador , the region distribut of influenza viru infect vari ; a higher detect rate of influenza A occur in quito , locat in the highland where the level of absolut humid is lower , wherea influenza A detect rate wa lower in the coastal citi of guayaquil , which ha a more humid tropic climat [ 15 ] . addit , an expand sentinel surveil of ili conduct at 31 health center and hospit locat in 13 peruvian citi show that the distribut of ili-caus virus vari by region [ 13 ] . these studi illustr the import of conduct baselin and continu ili surveil in other countri of central and south america becaus ili can be caus by pathogen other than influenza virus . the distribut of respiratori infect may vari within the region or within a particular countri , depend on climat and topographi . In venezuela , ari is the primari caus of weekli notifi diseas regist by the nation epidemiolog surveil system ( ness ) [ 17 ] . nonetheless , veri low number of respiratori sampl were collect ( 16,664 from 2006 to 2010 ) and even lower number ( 5,167 ) were confirm by the nation system for virolog surveil of ari [ 17â­21 ] . furthermor , the epidemiolog , clinic characterist , and viral caus of ili have been poorli character in venezuela ; to our knowledg , onli one longitudin studi , carri out dure a limit period of time ( februari 2005â­juli 2006 ) and with a low number of patient ( n = 102 ) with ari , ha been publish [ 22 ] . the object of thi paper is to describ the epidemiolog of ili use data from a sentinel surveil system at two major hospit in maracay , venezuela . result gener find A total of 916 subject particip in thi studi . six hundr and thirti seven ( 69.5 % ) were recruit at the hospit central de maracay ( hcm ) . there wa a slightli larger proport of femal compar with male who enrol in the studi ( 55.2 % vs 44.8 % ) , and the gender distribut at the two site were similar . subject age rang from 1 month to 86 year with a mean age of 19.2 year ( s.d . = 14.3 year ) and a median of 17 year . A signific percentag of the subject ( 17.6 % ) were under 5 year of age , while less than 1.0 % were 60 year or older . the 15â­29 year old group wa the most predomin group compris 32.8 % of the studi popul , follow by the 5â­14 year old age group ( 27.2 % ) . the subject who present to hcm were significantli older ( mean age = 21.2 year ; s.d . = 13.2 year ) compar with those who were seen at the hospit del instituto venezolano de lo seguro social jose maria carabano tosta ( ivss-jmct ) ( mean age = 14.4 year ; s.d . = 15.6 year ) .

A slight increas can be seen between the 30â­44 year old group ( 14.1 % ) and 60 year or older group ( 14.3 % ) . subject who were 60 year old or older compris less than 1 % of the studi popul , and thu , the preval in thi age group may be unreli . contrari to our studi , the other studi from . venezuela had higher detect rate in both the 0â­6 and $ 41 year old group ( 48.2 % and 57.1 % , respect ) [ 22 ] . On the other hand , our find are consist with observ in the tecumseh studi , a community-bas surveil in michi- gan , in which children were shown to have the highest rate of viral respiratori diseas [ 5,6 ] . the tecumseh studi further illustr the variabl impact of influenza virus among the differ age group depend on the influenza viru subtyp . for exampl , influenza a/h3n2 affect a wide rang of age group while influenza a/h1n1 and influenza B viru infect occur more frequent among older children and young adult [ 5,6 ] . our find were similar be season influenza a/h1n1 virus and influenza B detect primarili in children and young adult , and season influenza a/h3n2 found in all age group . As expect , ph1n1 wa the most common influenza A subtyp identifi among the subject with ili in 2009 ( figur 3 ) . In 2009 , 37.5 % ( figur 3 ) of ili case were due to ph1n1 ; thi detect rate wa lower than the 52.2 % detect rate report by the venezuela 's ness [ 21 ] . nevertheless , thi find wa similarli demonstr in respiratori ill surveil network in other tropic and temper south american countri such as guatemala [ 27 ] , peru [ 28 ] , argentina [ 29 ] , and brazil [ 30 ] .
