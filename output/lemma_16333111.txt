HA is synthes as a singl polypeptid that is subsequ cleav into two polypeptid , ha1 and ha2 . the ha1 polypeptid mutat more frequent than ha2 and play a crucial role in natur select ( 13 , 14 ) . five antigen site ( A to E ) on the three-dimension structur of the HA protein of a/aichi/2/68 ( h3n2 ) have been propos to be the antibody-bind site of the protein ( 13 , 14 ) . about one-third of the ha1 amino acid lie on or near these five antigen site , although the import of these amino acid posit is not clear ( 6 ) . recent , sever mod- el have been propos to predict the antigen evolut of the a/h3n2 virus ( 6 , 8 , 9 , 11 ) . a/panama/2007/99-lik virus have been circul world- wide sinc 1999 , which predat the emerg of a/fujian/ 411/2002-like virus . the appear of a/fujian/411/2002- like virus prompt a chang in the select of vaccin compon for the southern hemispher in 2003 and for the southern and northern hemispher in 2004 . In thi report , we util a high-throughput sequenc method to determin the nucleotid sequenc of the ha1 gene segment of influ- enza viru in nasal swab collect from infect children age 6 month and older dure the 2001-2003 influenza season . the specimen were divid into the follow five group , base on the date of collect ( tabl 1 ) : group 1 , 3 , and 5 were from asian countri , includ bangladesh , singapor , malaysia , and south korea , and group 2 and 4 were from european countri , includ the unit kingdom , scotland , finland , the netherland , poland , and itali . viral rna wa extract from influenza virus propag onc in mdck cell as previous describ ( 4 ) . ha1 fragment correspond- ing to nucleotid 37 to 1154 were amplifi by revers tran- scription-pcr use oligonucleotid 5-ctatcattgctt tgagctac ( primer 1 ) and 5-atctgctgcttgtcctgt GC ( primer 2 ) . the pcr product were purifi and subject to sequenc on a genet analyz ( abi prism 3100 ; ap- pli biosystem , foster citi , CA ) with the above-ment oligonucleotid and two addit oligonucleotid , 5-atg ccaaacaatgacaaatt ( primer 3 ) and 5-tgtttg gcatagtcacgttc ( primer 4 ) , except for group 3 speci- men , for which onli primer 1 and 4 were use for sequenc . multipl align of the sequenc were perform by the clustalv method , and the phylogenet tree wa construct by the neighbor-join method use megalign version 5.03 ( dnastar ) as previous describ ( 4 ) . A total of 13 amino acid chang were found in the ha1 protein of the refer vaccin strain , a/fujian/411/2002 , compar to that of the a/panama/2007/99 strain , includ chang at posit 21 , 25 , 50 , 75 , 83 , 131 , 155 , 156 , 183 , 186 , 202 , 222 , and 225 . these chang were alloc to the ha1 sequenc for the five group of specimen ; the result are summar in tabl 1 . for phylogenet analysi , 25 ha1 sequenc ( five from each of the five group ) were select from 146 specimen in an attempt to repres the varieti within each group . the sequenc form cluster ( fig . 1 ) that correspond to differ stage of antigen drift . We at- tempt to establish a pattern by further examin the ha1 sequenc of all 146 specimen with respect to these 13 amino acid chang . figur 2 show the frequenc of individu amino acid chang within each group . the ha1 sequenc in group 1 and 2 all exhibit amino acid chang s21p , l183h , and s186g , regardless of origin ( asia or europ ) , suggest that these three chang were inherit from earlier drift . six addit chang ( r50g , e83k , a131t , v202i , w222r , and g225d ) were detect in group 1 sequenc , five of which ( all but a131t ) were also observ in group 2 . more chang were detect in specimen in later group . nearli half ( 47 % ) of the sequenc from group 3 exhibit 12 of the 13 chang found in the ha1 sequenc of a/fujian/411/2002 , includ the three amino acid substitut l25i , h75q , and h155t , which were also found in group 4 at a frequenc of 43 % . the * correspond author . mail address : appli immunolog and microbiolog divis , wyeth vaccin research , 401 N. middletown rd. , build 180 , pearl river , NY 10965 . phone : ( 845 ) 602-5115 . fax : ( 845 ) 602-5296 . e-mail : chengsm @ wyeth.com . 6130 occurr of these three substitut increas signifi- cantli , to 100 % , in group 5 . moreov , 39 % of group 4 ( european ) virus and 70 % of group 5 ( asian ) virus also exhibit an addit amino acid substitut , q156h , which appear to be critic for the antigen evolut of the virus from a/panama/2007/99-lik to a/fujian/411/ 2002-like , as report previous ( 3 ) . A hallmark of influenza viru is it abil to undergo rapid antigen variat ( 14 ) . new variant are usual subject to intens select pressur from exist human immun gain from exposur to their viral ancestor ( 5 ) . In thi studi , we investig the antigen drift of the ha1 se- quenc of the human influenza a/h3n2 viru dure the 2001-2003 influenza season . thi studi confirm a progres- sive antigen drift from predominantli a/panama/2007/99- like strain to a/fujian/411/2002-lik strain in our a/h3n2 influenza specimen dure the 2001-2003 season . among the 13 amino acid differ between the ha1 protein of a/fujian/411/2002 and that of a/panama/2007/99 , mani were detect befor march 2002 in both asia and europ . chang were more frequent and advanc in asia sinc onli 1 out of 17 specimen in group 2 exhibit amino acid chang other than s21p , l183h , and s186g ( fig . 2 ) . three amino acid chang -- l25i , h75q , and h155t -- were found later in the year 2002 but prior to the emerg of the key amino acid chang q156h . these three substitut were not found separ from each other and appear to occur at the same time , suggest that these three amino acid chang aros from a singl genet event . although most of the virus examin dure thi period were genet closer to a/fujian/411/2002 than to a/panama/2007/99 base on their ha1 sequenc , it wa not until the emerg of the last amino acid chang , q156h , that the antigen properti of the virus complet shift to that of a/fujian/411/2002 . In addit , 39 % of the european specimen collect from novemb 2002 to may 2003 contain a/fujian/411/2002-lik virus , base on the ha1 sequenc data . thi percentag is significantli higher than that previous report by paget et al . ( 7 ) , base mostli on classic serolog assay . howev , it is not clear whether the differ is due to sampl or to the sensit of the assay method . the sharp rise of the A/ fujian/411/2002-lik virus in the popul coincid with fig . 1 . phylogenet analys of influenza a/h3n2 virus base on 320 amino acid sequenc of ha1 . twenty-f ha1 sequenc ( five from each of the five group ) were select from 146 specimen in an attempt to repres the varieti within the same group . the chang in the deduc amino acid sequenc were compar with the sequenc of a/panama/2007/99 . onli the amino acid chang correspond to the sequenc of a/fujian/411/2002 are shown in squar bracket . bold letter indic the refer vaccin strain .

It is like that these chang alter the antigen properti of the viru and facilit the spread of a/fujian/ 411/2002-like virus in asia and europ as well as in other part of the world such as south africa ( 1 ) . the ha1 polypeptid ha been propos to contain five antigen site , base on a studi of it three-dimension struc- ture ( 13 ) . among the 13 amino acid chang in the ha1 protein of a/fujian/411/2002 compar to that of a/panama/ 2007/99 , at least 7 of them were locat in one of the five antigen site : r50g ( site C ) , h75q and e83k ( site E ) , a131t ( site A ) , and h155t , q156h , and s186g ( site B ) ( 6 ) . In addit , the l183h chang is involv in sialic acid receptor bind ( 12 ) . howev , not all amino acid chang in the ha1 sequenc were sustain . the major ( 94 % ) of ha1 se- quenc of european specimen from group 2 exhibit the chang a106v and n144d , which are not found in a/fujian/ 411/2002 , and the frequenc of these chang declin to 50 to 60 % in later european specimen ( group 4 ) . similarli , about 30 to 40 % of ha1 sequenc in asian specimen found in group 1 and 3 also exhibit these two chang . howev , none of the specimen in group 5 exhibit a106v , and less than 10 % exhibit n144d . nucleotid sequenc access number . the nucleotid se- quenc of the ha1 gene can be found in genbank under the indic access number : strain a/panama/2007/99 , isdncda001 ; strain a/fujian/411/2002 , isdn38157 ; 146 clinic specimen , dq179382 to dq179527 .
