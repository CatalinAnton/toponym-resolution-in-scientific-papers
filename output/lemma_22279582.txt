To date h1n1pdm ha been found in a few swine farm [ 12,14,15 ] , which further demonstr a two-way process of both gene and viru traffick between human and pig . though h1n1pdm ha remain antigen and genet stabl in human sinc it emer- genc , a novel reassort siv contain a h1n1pdm-like NA and seven other gene from triple-reassort h1n2 and euro- pean `` avian-lik '' h1n1 virus wa identifi in earli 2010 [ 16 ] , and that same year h1n1pdm wa shown to be evolv genet at a faster pace in pig than it wa in human [ 12,15,17 ] . effect control of circul influenza virus in swine popul is key to reduc consequ genesi of novel plo one | www.plosone.org 1 januari 2012 | volum 7 | issu 1 | e30328 pandem strain that threaten the health of both human and anim . studi have been conduct to identifi proinflammatori cytokin includ tnf-a , il-6 , il-12 , and ifn-a or ifn-c , which are upregul in lung or bronchoalveolar secret in siv-infect pig [ 18,19,20,21 ] and may be correl with clinic manifest . In an alveoli macrophage-deplet pig model , macrophag appear to be indispens to effect clearanc of siv from lung . A higher frequenc of cytotox T , cd T , and treg cell were also detect in infect pig lung [ 18 ] , which togeth with the induct of cytokin , contribut to pathogenesi of influenza infect in pig . explor the mecha- nism of regul of host respons is crucial for understand the pathogenesi of siv and for control swine influenza in pig . macrophag resid beneath the respiratori epithelium and surround alveoli are part of the first line defens against influenza virus . dure influenza viral replic in bronchial epitheli cell , macrophag are one of the earliest target to be infect . togeth with dendrit cell , macrophag coordin innat immun respons , which subsequ lead to adapt immun by initi antigen present and lymphocyt activ . macrophag are indispens in alveolar host defens and control influenza viru in pulmonari organ in pig [ 22 ] . while protect in launch host antivir respons and restrict viru spread , induc proinflammatori cytokin and chemokin are also the caus of pathogen for the host and may lead to acut respiratori failur ( arf ) , a major caus of death in highli pathogen h5n1 or h1n1pdm-infect human [ 23 ] . needless to say , the role of macrophag are critic to patho- genic as well as host protect in siv-infect pig . howev , littl is known about the mechan of how host respons are regul in pig or their macrophag . consid the critic role macrophag play in siv infect , and the threat that h1n1pdm could further evolv higher virul in pig and subsequ infect human , we were interest in profil host respons of swine macrophag to h1n1pdm , and more importantli , in explor the underli mechan of host respons regul includ antivir , proinflammatori respons , and apoptosi in pig . In thi report , we will demonstr that swine macrophag are suscept to infect by h1n1pdm . We will show a uniqu pattern of pro- inflammatori cytokin respons to the infect , which are distinctli regul by swine mitogen-activ protein ( map ) kinas . We have also observ cross-talk between map kinas and nfkb pathway , and our data indic that map kinas erk1/2 and jnk1/2 may impact the activ of nfkb through the induct of rig-1 , lead to ifn-b induct in h1n1pdm-infect swine macrophag . materi and method cell and reagent the 3d/4 cell use in our studi are a spontaneously- transform line of swine macrophag purchas from atcc ( manassa , VA ) and grown in rpmi 1640 medium ( invitrogen ) contain 10 % fetal bovin serum ( fb ) . mous anti-erk and anti-jnk antibodi as well as rabbit anti-phospho erk and anti- phospho jnk antibodi ( cell signal ) , anti-cytochrom c , anti-influenza ns1 , and alkalin phosphatas ( AP ) -conjug anti-rabbit and anti-mous igg antibodi ( santa cruz biotech- nolog ) were obtain from their respect provid . anti- cleav caspas antibodi wa obtain from cell signal technolog , and anti-bak antibodi wa obtain from emd chemic . the chemic purchas from emd chemic also includ inhibitor for map kinas , u0126 ( erk1/2 ) , sb203580 ( p38 ) , and insolut jnk inhibitor II ( jnk1/2 ) , and the inhibitor for nfkb and ikk ( 6-amino-4- ( 4-phenoxyphenylethy- lamino ) quinazolin ( cat . 481406 ) and wedelolacton ( cat . 401474 ) , respect ) . viru and viru infect a/nanjing/108/2009 ( h1n1 ) , a pandem ( h1n1 ) 2009 viru , wa isol from a swab sampl of an outpati febril child at the nanj children 's hospit dure the pandem in 2009 , nanj , china . the sampl procedur wa perform in accord with the rule set by the institut review board at the hospit . the eight genom segment of thi viru have been fulli sequenc and the raw data are deposit at genbank under access number jq173100 through jq173107 . the viru wa grown in 9-day-old embryon chicken egg ; viru allanto fluid ( vaf ) wa harvest 48 hr after inocul , then titrat with standard haemagglutin test ( HA ) and plaqu assay in mdck cell for HA and infecti viral titer , respect [ 24 ] . for viral infect , the 3d/4 cell were trypsin , resuspend in rpmi 1640 medium contain 10 % fb , and plate on 6-cm tissu cultur plate at 56106 cell per plate 12 hr befor infect . the cell were infect with h1n1pdm inocula in vaf at a multipl of infect ( moi ) of 1 . after 1 hr of adsorpt , the viru inocula were discard and 3 ml of serum-fre rpmi 1640 medium contain tpck-trypsin ( 1 mg/ml , sigma ) wa ad . the cell were incub at 37uc and 5 % co2 for variou time point befor cell lysat or total rna extract were prepar . real-tim rt-pcr mrna transcript level of ifn-b , il-1b , il-6 , il-8 , ccr5 , ip- 10 , tnf-a , fasl , trail , Mx , 2959-oa , retino acid-induc gene I ( rig-1 ) , melanoma differentiation-associ antigen 5 ( mda-5 ) , and glyceraldehyde-3-phosph dehydrogenas ( gapdh ) gene were analyz by a two-step real-tim rt-pcr assay as describ previous [ 25 ] . 1 mg of total rna , prepar from the cell use the rneasi kit ( qiagen ) , wa revers transcrib with the quantitect revers transcript kit ( qiagen ) follow the manufactur 's instruct . the sequenc of primer use in the studi are list in tabl 1 . the RT reaction wa carri out with the rna after treatment with dnase I at 42uc for 2 min . real-tim pcr wa conduct with 1 ml of cdna in a total volum of 25 ml with the iQ sybr green supermix ( bio-rad ) follow the manufactur 's instruct . rel express valu were normal use an intern gapdh control . the fold chang of rel gene express level wa calcul follow the formula : 2 ( dct of gene2dct of gapdh ) [ 25,26 ] . for each reaction , melt curv were analyz to determin the specif of each amplicon .

We found that the level of proinflammatori cytokin il-6 and il-8 were upregul up to 51- and 38-fold at 16 hr , respect , and the level of il-8 continu to rise up to 142- fold at 36 hr p.i.. howev , the level of il-1b remain unchang throughout the infect ( fig . 2A ) , indic that il-6 and il-8 , as well as tnf-a ( fig . 2B ) as describ later , were the main proinflammatori cytokin upregul . We observ a robust induct of antivir ifn-b , which rose up to 620- and 5,100-fold at 16 and 36 hr p.i. , respect ( fig . 2C ) . ifn-induc antivir protein Mx and 295.-oa were induc accordingli up to 910- and 12,510-fold , respect , at 36 hr p.i . ( fig . 2C ) . tnf famili member were also induc in respons to h1n1pdm infect , which may be attribut to cell death . We found that in pig macrophag the level of fasl and tnf-a remain undetect , while tnf-relat apoptosis-induc ligand ( trail ) seem to be most abund befor infect , base on Ct valu from realtim rt-pcr ( data not shown ) . fasl and tnf-a were induc most robustli , but trail wa onli mildli induc in respons to infect ( fig . 2B ) . among the induc , the level of tnf-a , critic in both cell death and inflamm , wa sharpli upregul up to 14- and 162-fold , and fasl up to 43- and 22-fold at 16 and 36 hr p.i. , respect . fasl and tnf-a may play a major role in h1n1pdm-trigger extrins apoptosi . 3 . activ of map kinas and nfkb in ph1n1-infect swine macrophag To understand the mechan of proinflammatori cytokin and tnf famili ligand induct in h1n1pdm-infect swine macrophag , we investig how map kinas were activ and whether their signal pathway were involv in the regul of variou cytokin and tnf famili ligand in pig immun cell . 3d/4 cell were infect with h1n1pdm , and cell lysat were prepar at variou time point for sds-page and western blot analys with specif anti-erk1/2 and anti-jnk1/2 antibodi . activ form of erk and jnk ( phospho-erk1/2 and phosphor-jnk1/2 ) were detect by anti-phospho-erk1/2 and anti-phospho-jnk antibodi . As shown in figur 3A , erk1/2 wa basal phosphoryl at a low level befor infect , but further phosphoryl between 9 and 18 hr and thereaft p.i.. phosphoryl and activ of jnk1/2 appear at 9 hr and increas to the peak around 18 hr p.i . ( fig . 3B ) . although both erk1/2 and jnk1/2 were activ in respons to h1n1pdm infect in swine macrophag , erk1/2 remain activ at basal level even befor infect , so did jnk1/2 as shown in some of our experi ( fig . 4B ) . howev , our data show that basal level phosphoryl of both erk1/2 and jnk1/2 remain unchang in uninfect 3d/4 cell through the period of our infect .

We then infect the cell with the viru and observ how infection- induc activ of map kinas wa affect by inhibit of the respect map kinas . As shown in figur 4A , 3d/4 cell were pre-treat with inhibitor of erk1/2 ( u0126 ) , p38 ( sb230058 ) , and jnk1/2 ( jnk insolut ) , at concentr of 10 mM , 5 mM , and 50 mM , respect . while the phosphoryl of erk1/2 wa unaffect- ed by treatment with the p38 and jnk inhibitor , it wa complet abolish at both 18 and 30 hr p.i . ( line 4тн5 ) by the erk1/2 inhibitor u0126 ( fig . 4A ) . We note that the basal level phosphoryl of erk1/2 diminish in the presenc of u0126 . On the other hand , in light of the p38 and jnk inhibit with their specif inhibitor , the phosphoryl of erk1/2 appear to be enhanc ( fig . 4A , line 6тн9 ) , indic that a compensatori mechan may exist among map kinas . We observ a similar respons in which a complet suppress of jnk1/2 phosphoryl wa observ ( line 8тн9 ) when the cell were pre-treat with the jnk1/2 inhibitor ( fig . 4B ) . howev , the phosphoryl of jnk1/2 wa not suppress at all by the inhibitor of erk1/2 and p38 . We note that there were doubl band for jnk1 , and a lower band of jnk1 usual appear at a later stage of infect ( 30 hr p.i. ) . thi band wa detect mainli by anti-jnk1/2 , but not by anti-phospho-jnk1/ 2 , indic that jnk activ wa transient and dephosphor- ylation of jnk occur at later stage of infect , probabl by an uncharacter map kinas phosphatas ( mkp ) present in pig .

We observ that il-1b wa bare detect and not induc dure h1n1pdm infect . interestingli , we notic that il-1b wa upregul in the presenc of the jnk inhibitor , although no chang wa observ after the treatment by the erk inhibitor , indic that il-1b could have been induc in swine macrophag infect with h1n1pdm , but wa virtual sup- press by jnk1/2 ( fig . 5A ) . We observ that the induct of il-6 , il-8 , and il-10 wa complet suppress in the presenc of the erk1/2 inhibitor , which indic that il-6 , il-8 , and il-10 induct are all depend on the erk signal pathway ( fig . 5bтнd ) . It is interest to note that jnk1/2 may play differ role in the induct of il-6 , il-8 , and il-10 base on their respons in the presenc of the jnk inhibitor . jnk1/2 may have moder effect in the induct of il-6 ( fig . 5B ) , but may be not relev at all to the induct of either il-8 or il-10 ( fig . 5cтнd ) . We also note that ccl5 ( rant ) wa strongli regul by erk1/2 and jnk1/2 in swine immun cell . As shown in figur 5E , induct of ccl5 wa effici block in the presenc of either erk1/2 or jnk1/2 inhibitor , indic that ccl5 is induc by h1n1pdm infect through erk and jnk signal pathway . As for antivir ifn-b , which wa robustli induc with h1n1pdm infect in swine macrophag , erk1/2 appear to be essenti sinc the induct of it mrna transcript wa virtual abolish in the presenc of the erk inhibitor ( fig . 6A ) . jnk1/2 may also play a role in ifn-b induct becaus of it signific decreas at the earlier stage of infect ( 16 hr p.i . ) when 3d/4 cell were pre-treat with the jnk inhibitor . howev , erk1/2 seem to be the primari pathway in the ifn-b induct in swine macrophag . the distinct contribut to the induct of ifn-b by erk1/2 and jnk1/2 were also reflect in the decreas mrna transcript level of ifn-induc antivir protein , Mx and 2959-oa , in the presenc of erk and jnk inhibitor , respect ( fig . 6bтнc ) , which is in accord with the suppress of the ifn-b induct by these same compound in the infect cell . both Mx and 2959-oa were suppress significantli by the erk inhibitor , but onli the figur 4 . specif inhibit of phosphoryl and activ of swine map kinas and nfkb in h1n1pdm-infect 3d/3 cell . swine macrophag were pretreat with u0126 , sb230058 , and insolut jnk inhibitor , which are inhibitor of erk1/2 , p38 , and jnk1/2 , respect . the final concentr of the inhibitor were 10 mM , 5 mM , and 50 mM for u0126 , sb230058 , and the insolut jnk inhibitor , respect . after 1 hr incub , the treat cell were infect with h1n1pdm at an moi of 1 , and the cell lysat were prepar at 18 and 30 hr post infect . the cell lysat were subject to sds-page and western blot analysi with anti-phospho-erk1/2 and anti-phospho-jnk1/2 antibodi .

In contrast , il-1b wa not induc , and wa bare detect in pig macrophag . thi pattern differ from that in bronchoalveolar secret of siv-infect pig in which il-1b wa induc but il-8 wa not [ 19,20,21,22,25 ] . the differ cell type involv ( macrophag and epitheli cell ) may account for the differ . It ha previous been report that in human immun cell and patient a weak innat immun respons , evidenc by a poor induct of proinflammatori and antivir cytokin includ ifn-b and tnf-a , ha been observ in human monocyte-deriv dc and macrophag infect with h1n1pdm , compar to season h1n1 infect [ 31 ] . highli pathogen h5n1 viral infect in human macrophag induc higher express of il-6 and ccl5 ( rant ) than ph1n1 [ 32 ] , which may explain gener mild clinic diseas among h1n1pdm-infect patient . In human macrophag , similar to our find , il-1b wa not detect . map kinas signal pathway and their role in the regul of cytokin and viral replic have not been character in influenza-infect pig immun cell . In thi studi , we found that erk1/2 and jnk1/2 could both be activ in swine macrophag . We note that erk1/2 wa phosphoryl and activ at a low level constitut , which may be import for the rapid physiolog respons requir upon infect . To elucid the mechan that regul swine host respons , we use specif inhibitor of map kinas to pre-treat macrophag befor infect . We determin that the induct of ifn-b , il-6 , il-8 , and il-10 were regul by erk1/2 , while jnk1/2 may onli play a minor or no role in the regul of these cytokin . As describ earlier , il-1b wa not induc in respons to the ph1n1 infect , which could be explain by our data indic that it induct wa in fact effici suppress by jnk1/2 in swine macrophag . thi may be the first time that jnk1/2 inhibitori effect on the induct of proinflammatori cytokin have been demonstr . previou studi found that ifn induct wa depend on the jnk1/2 signal pathway in epitheli cell infect with influenza viru infect [ 33 ] . howev , our data clearli demonstr that erk1/2 play a major role in the regul of ifn-b in pig macrophag , which may indic that the regul of ifn differ in differ cell type . We note that basal level activ of both erk1/2 and jnk1/2 were constitut present in non-infect 3d/4 cell , which may be import in the induct of proinflammatori and antivir cytokin at the earli stage of infect . our data indic that the induct of il-6 , il-8 , il-10 , ccl-5 , as well as ifn-b , were appar at the earliest stage of viral infect even befor erk1/2 wa further activ . We realiz that a transform monocyt cell line , instead of primari cell , wa use in the studi , which may compromis the signific of our data . basal level phosphoryl of both erk1/ 2 and jnk1/2 , which may affect certain cytokin product , would be minim in primari monocyt . howev , specif inhibitor use in the studi complet wipe out phosphoryl of both erk1/2 and jnk1/2 ( fig . 4 ) . the effect of map kinas phosphoryl and activ on the regul of affect cytokin as observ in our studi with the inhibitor is , therefor , valid , even though the cell were not primari cultur . macrophag appear to die inevit of apoptosi when infect with influenza viru [ 26 ] . the fas-medi extrins apoptot pathway is appar trigger by tnf famili ligand . while both fasl and tnf-a were induc vigor upon the viral infect , induct of trail wa rather mild in h1n1pdm- infect swine macrophag . We knew previous that fasl and tnf-a were bare detect , while the level of trail remain high prior to the infect base on our realtim rt-pcr data ( Ct ) ( xing et al. , unpublish data ) . We can therefor presum that h1n1pdm-induc apoptosi may be mainli attribut to fasl and tnf-a , while pig macrophag could be resist to trail , sinc the cell remain intact despit the presenc of a high level of trail befor infect . furthermor , we were also abl to determin that both erk1/2 and jnk1/2 were involv in the induct of fasl , tnf-a , and trail . fasl is also regul by erk1 in chicken macrophag infect with an h9n2 avian influenza viru [ 34 ] . both toll-lik receptor ( tlr ) and rna helicas , such as rig- 1 and mda-5 , are critic to antivir innat immun [ 35,36 ] . As a cytosol sensor , rig-1 bind to dsrna and viral ssrna that contain a 59-triphosph not present in host rna , and then is recruit to mitochondri protein ip via the card domain , lead to activ of nfkb , irf-3/-7 , and induct of ifn [ 37,38,39 ] . rig-1 can be induc by viral infect [ 40 ] . In thi studi , we observ a robust induct of rig-1 and mda-5 in h1n1pdm-infect swine macrophag , which appear to be suppress complet by inhibitor of erk1/2 or jnk1/2 , but to be a much lesser extent , by the inhibitor of p38 . thi indic that the induct of rig-1 or mda-5 depend on the activ of erk1/2 and jnk1/2 in pig macrophag . We postul a mechan , therefor , that the cross-talk between map kinas and nfkb pathway is through the regul of rig-1 and mayb mda-5 , and that erk1/2 control the activ of nfkb , lead to the induct of ifn in swine macrophag . acknowledg We thank member of xing laboratori for their technic assist in the studi and help discuss for manuscript prepar .
