At the protein level , human viru np have evolv twice as fast as classic swine viru np ( 0.66 versu 0.34 amino acid chang per year ) . despit evid of frequent interspeci transmiss of human and classic swine virus , our analysi indic that these virus have evolv independ sinc well befor the first isol in the earli 1930 . although our analysi can not reveal the origin host , the ancestor viru wa avianlik , show onli five amino acid differ from the root of the avian viru NP lineag . the common pattern of relationship and origin for the NP and other gene of hlnl human and classic swine virus suggest that the common ancestor wa an avian viru and not a reassort deriv from previou human or swine influenza A virus . the new avianlik hlnl swine virus in europ may provid a model for the evolut of newli introduc avian virus into the swine host reservoir . the np of these virus are evolv more rapidli than those of human or classic swine virus ( 4.50 nucleotid chang and 0.74 amino acid chang per year ) , and when these rate are appli to pre-1930 human and classic swine viru np , the predict date of a common ancestor is 1918 rather than 1912 to 1913 . thu , our NP phylogeni is consist with histor record and the propos that a short time befor 1918 , a new hlnl avianlik viru enter human or swine host ( 0 . T. gorman , R. 0 . doni , Y. kawaoka , and R. G. webster , J. virol . 64:4893-4902 , 1990 ) . thi viru provid the ancestor of all known human influenza A viru gene , except for HA , NA , and pb1 , which have sinc been reassort from avian virus . We propos that dure 1918 a virul strain ofthi new avianlik viru caus a sever human influenza pandem and that the pandem viru wa introduc into north american swine popul , constitut the origin of classic swine viru . the influenza viru pandem of 1918 claim more than 20 million live ( 9 ) . resolv the origin of thi virul viru ha been a major focu of virolog research for more than 60 year . antigen and seroarcheolog studi sinc the 1930 ( see , e.g. , refer 2 , 11 , 12 , 17 , 18 , and 27 ) have indic that the earli human and classic swine influenza A hlnl virus ( i.e. , those relat to swine/iowa/15/30 ) were veri similar . swine are suscept to human influenza virus and vice versa ( 19 , 20 ) , and avianlik hlnl and h3n2 virus have been isol from pig ( 23 , 38 , 44 ) . scholtissek et al . ( 39 ) propos that swine may provid an effici `` mix vessel '' for the introduct of reassort virus into the human popul . thi hypothesi may explain the appear of new pandem virus in the human popul ( 40 ) . the nucleoprotein ( NP ) gene ha been chosen for evolu- tionari studi of influenza A virus ( see , e.g. , refer 13 and 15 ) becaus it purport role as a determin ofhost rang ( 39 , 45 , 47 ) predict that NP gene evolut should be host specif . thu , the NP gene may serv as a model for * correspond author . t present address : u. . fish and wildlif servic , flagstaff , AZ 86001. host-specif evolut of influenza virus . use rna hybriz techniqu , bean ( 3 ) show that NP gene fall into five host-specif group . thi find wa confirm by show that NP gene have evolv into five major host- specif lineag that correspond to bean 's rna hybriz group ( 15 ) . the inclus ofboth human and classic swine viru np into one lineag suggest that they share a common ancestor . the above-ment antigen studi of hlnl human and classic swine virus predict the same close relationship for surfac protein , hemagglutinin ( HA ) and neuraminidas ( NA ) . evolutionari analys of other intern protein gene of influenza A virus also show a close relationship between human and classic swine vi- ruse ( M and NS [ 31 ] , pb1 [ 22 ] , PA [ 35 ] , pb2 [ 16 ] ) , and these virus appear to be evolv away from avianlik ancestor ( 15 , 16 ) . thi common pattern of evolut and origin for all viru gene suggest that the common ancestor wa an avian viru and not a reassort deriv from previou human or swine influenza A virus ( 16 ) . To date , evolutionari analys of influenza A viru gene includ sequenc for onli a few classic swine virus , and human viru gene sequenc are heavili bias toward recent viru isol . clearli , the lack of repres sequenc data for swine virus preclud an evolutionari analysi of classic swine virus , and the bia in human 3704 evolut OF human and swine hlnl virus 3705 viru sequenc data weaken the accuraci of publish evolutionari analys . for exampl , gammelin et al . ( 13 ) and gorman et al . ( 15 ) show NP gene of recent classic swine viru isol as diverg befor the common ances- tor of human and the earliest classic swine virus . We believ that thi portray of two separ lineag of clas- sical swine viru np is an artifactu result of not have repres classic swine viru np between 1931 and 1977 . these defici hamper our understand of the origin of human influenza virus and the potenti role of swine host in that origin . our aim ha been to determin the evolutionari relation- ship of human and swine influenza virus . specif , we have address the follow question . ( i ) Do human and classic swine virus share a singl common ancestor ? If so , what wa the host ofthi common ancestor and what wa the date of diverg into human and swine viru lineag ? ( ii ) how doe viru evolut differ in the two host speci ? have hlnl human and classic swine virus evolv independ ; i.e. , is there ani evid for a common gene pool for human and swine virus ? ( iii ) what can the evolut of new avianlik virus in swine reveal about the earli evolut of hlnl human and classic swine virus ? ( iv ) what is the relationship between the origin of hlnl human and classic swine virus and the 1918 influenza pandem ? To address these question , we have includ 37 addit sequenc that address the defici in previ- ou analys . the present expand evolutionari analysi of 89 NP gene is intend to complement our previou analy- si of 41 NP gene ( 15 ) . materi and method We select 37 influenza A viru isol ( 16 swine , 7 human , 13 avian , and 1 equin ) from which to clone and sequenc NP gene ( tabl 1 ) . mani of the earli swine viru isol ( swoh35 , sw29-37 , swjms42 , swia46 , sw41- 49 , swmay54 , and swwis57 ) were kindli provid by H. F. maassab and were from the franci histor influ- enza collect at the univers of michigan . remain isol were select to complement 24 NP gene that we previous sequenc ( 15 ) and 28 other from literatur and databank sourc ( tabl 1 ) . molecular clone , sequenc , and sequenc analysi were perform as previous describ ( 15 , 16 ) . briefli , cdna of viral NP rna were ligat into plasmid vector and were then transfect into compet escherichia coli . for each viru strain , two to five NP clone were sequenc . phylogenet analysi of sequenc data wa perform with paup ( phylogenet analysi use parsimoni ) softwar , version 2.4 ( david swofford , illinoi natur histori sur- vey , champaign , ill. ) . result evolutionari tree of NP gene nucleotid sequenc . A phylogenet analysi of 89 influenza A viru NP gene sequenc is present as an evolutionari tree root to an align influenza B viru NP ( fig . 1A ) . the gener topolog of the tree is similar to that of our previou analysi ( 15 ) , except that now the human and classic swine viru np are shown share a singl common ancestor ( upper star in fig . 1A ) and eqpr56 is slightli closer to other NP lineag . the human lineag contain three exampl of humanlik virus isol from swine : swcam35 , swhk76 , swdan83 . It is notabl that swcam35 is not a classic swine viru and is most close relat to ws33 , the first human viru isol . the isol swhk76 and swdan83 repres humanlik swine virus from china . within the classic swine viru NP lineag are two exampl of swinelik virus isol from human , nj76 and wis88 . these two virus are independ deriv and are close relat to contempo- rari strain isol from pig ( swtn77 and swia88 , respect ) . thi pattern emphas the suscept of swine to human virus and vice versa , but these interspe- cie transmiss appear to repres evolutionari dead end sinc there is no evid that they circul exten- sive or leav descend virus . the classic swine NP lineag contain a subgroup of isol that have not evolv significantli for 19 year rel to the origin swia30 isol ( swjms42 , swia46 , and sw41-49 ) . the lack of accompani data for these three isol preclud ani explan for thi pattern . howev , the remain isol fall in the expect chrono- logic order within the lineag . the onli asian isol repre- sent in the hlnl classic swine viru lineag , swhk82 , appear to be a reassort contain avian h3n2 surfac protein ( 23 ) . the classic swine viru NP of thi isol is relat to north american strain in the mid-1970 . thi agre with the appear of classic swine virus anti- genicli similar to north american strain in the late 1970 in southeast asia ( 43 ) and japan ( 34 , 51 ) . A distinct sublineag of italian swine viru isol ( swit76 , swit79 , swit41-81 , and swit47-81 ) support the report introduct of classic swine virus into itali in 1976 ( 32 ) . howev , antigen analys of italian swine viru isol ( 12a ) indic that classic swine virus disappear from itali after 1986 and have been replac by avianlik hlnl swine virus . these new avianlik swine virus first appear in europ in 1979 ( 38 ) , but antigen analys suggest that they began to circul in itali in 1985 ( 12a ) . the time of the appear of the new avianlik hlnl virus in itali ( 1985 ) and the disappear of classic swine virus ( 1986 ) suggest that the new swine viru in some way hasten the extinct of classic swine virus in itali . within the avian NP lineag , onli one asian swine isol is repres ( swhk2-82 ) and is close relat to a h3n2 asian duck isol ( dkhk75 ) . kida et al . ( 23 ) provid addit exampl of h3n2 avianlik virus isol from pig in southern china . antigen studi of swine viru isol from southern china suggest that pig are commonli infect with h3n2 human and avian virus ( 43 ) . howev , there are no data to indic whether these h3n2 avian virus circul and evolv in the asian swine host reser- voir . In contrast , the new avianlik european swine virus form a distinct sublineag within the avian lineag ( swger81 , swned85 , and swit89 [ fig . 1A ] ) . the for- mation of a swine-specif lineag indic that these new swine virus are circul in the swine host reservoir and have begun to evolv separ from their avian ancestor . other exampl of avianlik swine virus isol from mammal includ those isol from whale ( whalem84 and whalep76 ) , seal ( seal80 ) , and mink ( minksw84 ) ( fig . 1 ) . In everi case these isol appear to be indepen- dentli deriv from avian virus . the inabl to isol descend strain indic that transmiss of avian virus to marin mammal repres evolutionari dead end ( 25 ) . evolutionari tree of amino acid sequenc .

In essenc , the amino acid tree repres a phylogeni base on nonsil chang ; the collaps of intern branch in the avian lineag indic that nearli all the homolog intern branch in the nucleotid tree are compos of silent chang . A compari- son of human and classic swine viru sublineag reveal that at the nucleotid level they have evolv roughli the same amount from their common ancestor ( i.e. , the two branch are similar in length [ fig . 1A ] ) . howev , at the amino acid level the classic swine viru np are evolv much more slowli ( fig . 1B ) , which suggest that swine virus are subject to less select pressur than are human virus . the avian lineag is character by evolutionari stasi of np ( fig . 1B ) as note previous ( 15 ) . swhk2-82 , an asian avianlik swine viru isol , is veri similar to an asian duck viru isol , dkhk75 ( three amino acid differ- enc [ fig . 1B ] ) . In contrast to other np of the avian lineag , those from avianlik european swine viru isol ( swger81 , swned85 , and swit89 ) form a distinct sub- lineag that show a progress accumul of amino acid chang consist with date of isol . comparison of amino acid sequenc . To detect pattern of deriv ( synapomorph ) amino acid chang for each lin- eag , we compar NP sequenc with baselin sequenc that are closest to the root of the phylogenet tree ( a tabl of align sequenc is avail upon request ) . the dkbav77 , mast82 , and mast2-82 isol are one amino acid chang from the root node of the avian lineag , which repres the hypothet ancestor for all avian np ( fig . 1B , lower star ) . thi analysi permit identif of the specif amino acid chang that have occur in the evolut of host-specif np and permit reconstruct of sequenc for hypothet- ical ancestr np ( fig . 2 ) . two possibl sequenc for hypothet ancestr avian np ( fig . 2 , avian 1 and avian 2 ) differ at amino acid posit 105 and 450 . these amino acid differ distinguish the common ancestor for h13 gull and north american avian from old world avian group . the common ancestor of human and classic swine NP lineag ( fig . 2 , hum-swin ) is character by five vol . 65 , 1991 3708 gorman ET AL . eopr56 ( ( h7n7 ) eom163 ( h3n ( ) 43 6o00on73 ( h7n7 ) *eoky86 ( h3n ) X eotn86 ( h3n48 ) swcam35 ( h11 ) 4ws33 ( him ) pr834 ( h14n ) 1824 pr8cam34 ( h14 ) I I I I I r hlck~~~wox40 ( h1nl ) 18928 f47 ( H '' ) i8815 ( him ) u18811ssr77 ( H1 ) 1brazl78 ( h1n1 ) | 1 19471 _ ~~~~~~eng55 ( h1n1 ) 5s4457 ( h2n2 ) I I I Ll I r ~~~~~~~~~vic68 ( m2n2 ) 1868| 14788nt60-68 ( h3n2 ) |s12 | W 13 sw476 ( h3n2 ) 112 *u8 1 ( 50or1472 ( h3n2 ) 18 70texas77 ( h3n2 ) calf78 ( h1n1 ) wdan683 ( ( h3n2 ) 8683 ( h3n2 ) aarbor60 ( h2n2 ) 1swla30 ( HI ) 4sw31 ( h11 ) | | si46 ( h1lnl ) 1sw4642 ( HI ) 1825 8s41-49 ( h1n1 ) 140swoh35 ( him ) 5128-37 ( HI ) swit141-81 ( H ) L -4~ ~ ~ ~ r -- 601 ( 411 .csw14 ( t17-81 ( hwi ) ] I1 7 9 ( 1 ) 1873 rnj76 ( H8 ) 146sww82 ( h3n2 ) v 1 4st7t ( hini ) 1sww , s 514swont81 ( h11 ) 61 ( H '' ) wis88 ( h1m ) 141swn8 ( HI ) glxast84 ( mim ) , gllm77 ( h13ng ) iglmd78 ( h13n9 ) iglmd79 ( h13n6 ) gllwoo ( hu3ng ) whalem84 ( h13n2 ) | - gulm~~~~~~aso ( hl3n6 ) |dkman53 ( h11n7 ) tyont66 ( hsn9 ) gulm5-77 ( h149 ) I I I r ~~~dkpen69 ( h6ni ) dkmem74 ( h3n8 ) .mlrdny78 ( h2n2 ) rtnj85 ( h4n6 ) tymn80 ( h4n2 ) tywm48 ( hn1 ) _ ( ppnn4835 ( h5n2 ) iealim ( h7n7 ) idknz76 ( h4n6 ) | -G T A U s~~~79 ( h4n4 ) _fpv4i71 1688 * crger4940l~a~ ( 14104n7 ) dkcz 56 ( h46 ) dji keng56 ( htn6 ) 1dkuk80 ( H1 8 ) 188 2 ( 14dkeng62 ( h4n1 ) 4ternsag161 ( 13 ) llpwhalep76 ( hin3 ) 188,9 18paru73 ( h7n1 ) 06kb6077 ( him ) 1841 61 budhok77 ( h4n6 ) 6dkw75 ( h3n2 ) 108 | rl -swhk2-82 ( h3n2 ) 06kau580 ( h414 ) nudeob0 @ chtrq m | ke78 ( h3n6 ) 8n5782 ( h141n ) 84mas2-82 ( 141488 ) 7641 ( 588 ( h7n7 ) lminksw84 ( h10n4 ) 51wtr72 ( ( h6n5 ) sger81 ( hlnl ) 1619 5146new5 ( him ) 1-4sw 89 ( h1n1 ) II B iii 'cl iv * eopr56 ( h7n7 ) eomt63 ( h3n8 ) no773 ( h17n17 ) eotn86 ( h3n8 ) S 5cam3 ( h1n1 ) ws33 ( h1n4 ) pr834 ( htnl ) -pr8cam34 ( hn41 ) 0hickox40 ( hinm ) fm47 ( hnl ) warrenso ( hln ) brazl78 1en455 ( hini ) _*lit - s4ng57 ( h2n2 ) _v1c68 ( h2n2 ) nt60-66 ) H ) 2 ( _ _r1swhk76 ( h3n2 ) SW ) a30 ( htn1 ) _ 1sw31 ( hnl ) slswia46 ( hlnl ) _ swjms42 ( hin1 ) _sw41-49 ( htni ) aaf swoh35 ( h1141 ) sw29-37 ( h144 ) swmay54 ( h1n1 ) swwe57 ( h144 ) swit141-81 ( him ) swit147-81 ( hnt ) 4swit79 ( him ) swit76 ( h1n1 ) 4nj76 ( h1n1 ) swhk82 ( h3n2 ) _ 1* stn77 ( 14141 ) wn8148 ( h14n1 ) H1 ) lswwis561 ( hin1 ) 5last84 ( hw3n6 ) gumd77 ( h13n6 ) G qlmd78 ( h13n9 ) gulmd79 ( h13n6 ) g_-g ulm 80 ( h13n6 ) _gulma80 ( h13n6 ) whalem84 ( h13n2 ) r 6kman53 ( h1on7 ) - tyont66 ( ( hsn9 ) - g8lm5-77 ( h119 ) D dkpen69 ( h6n1 ) dkmem74 ( h3n8 ) *0mrdny78 ( h2n2 ) 17rtnj85 ( h4n6 ) 4tymn80 ( ( h4n2 ) ckpenn83 ( h5n2 ) sealbo ( h7n7 ) 1tymn81 ( h1n1 ) dknz76 ( h4n6 ) - gtaus79 ( h4n4 ) - fpv ? 77 ( h7n7 ) _ fpv34 ( h7nt ) ckger49 ( h1on7 ) dkcz56 ( h4n6 ) 6dken1g56 ( hlln6 ) 0kuk60 ( h11n8 ) d^keng62 ( h4n6 ) iternsa61 ( h5n3 ) 16whalep76 ( h1n3 ) paru73 ( h7nt ) d*6kb677 ( h1n1 ) 0 bugrh1077 ( h4n6 ) dk8675 ( h3n2 ) 1sw4k2-82 ( h3n2 ) dkbe178 ( h3n6 ) mast82 ( h14n6 ) m*ast2-82 ( h41n5 ) dkaus80 ( hini ) tealic80 ( h7n7 ) minsw84 ( hton4 ) shwtr72 ( h6n5 ) 1-s45er81 ( hn1 ) 1swned85 ( hin1 ) 1swit89 ( h1ni ) -udorn72 ( h3n2 ) texa577 ( h3n2 ) calf78 ( hn1i ) sw0an83 ( h3n2 ) hk83 ( h3n42 ) rbor60 ( h2n2 ) *w amino Ac chne fig . 1 .

A regress of branch dis- tanc of NP isol from common ancestor node permit estim of evolutionari rate for the human lineag and , for the first time , the classic swine viru lineag ( fig . 3 ) . At the nucleotid level , human and swine viru NP gene are evolv at nearli ident rate ( 3.31 to 3.41 nucleotid chang per year [ fig . 3 ] ) , but at the protein level the swine viru np are evolv at half the rate of human viru np ( 0.66 versu 0.34 amino acid chang per year [ fig . 3 ] ) . the per-nucleotid annual rate of chang is 2.12 x 10-3 to 2.18 x 10-3 chang per year for swine and human viru np , respect . these valu are higher than our previou estim of 1.62 x 10-3 chang per year for the human NP lineag ( 15 ) , which wa base on fewer human viru np ( 6 versu 20 isol ) , but are veri close to the 2.2 x 10-3 chang per year estim for human viru np ( 1 ) and are similar to the estim of 2.0 x 10-3 chang per year for the NS gene ( 6 ) . our estim of evolutionari rate for old world avian np ( 1.90 chang per gene per year , 1.21 x 10-3 chang per nucleotid per year [ fig . 4 ] ) is lower than previous report ( 2.17 chang per gene per year ; 1.39 x 10-3 chang per nucleotid per year ) ( 15 ) . the new estim may be regard as more accur sinc it is base on a larger sampl of avian np ( 22 versu 13 np ) . np of reemerg hlnl human virus ( ussr77 and brazil78 ) share a common ancestor with the warren50 isol as previous shown ( 1 ) or predict ( 29 , 41 ) . assum- ing a 1950 origin , we treat these reemerg isol as appear in 1951 ( ussr77 ) and 1952 ( brazil78 ) . the close posit ofthes isol to the regress line support the interpret that they had not been in circul for 27 year . date for common-ancestor node can be deriv from estim of evolutionari rate for each lineag . indepen- dent estim from the human and classic swine viru vol . 65 , 1991 3710 gorman ET AL .

It is not possibl from thi analysi to determin the host in which the viru first appear . If there had been some asymmetri in the lineag , e.g. , earli swine viru np form a sister group to np of later human and classic swine virus , thi would have provid some evid that pig were the origin host . instead , the two nucleotid lineag are highli symmetr and estim virtual the same date for a common ancestor . gammelin et al . ( 13 ) have propos that the common ancestor for avian and human viru np may have exist as far back as 1837 . In their analysi , human viru NP amino acid evolutionari rate over the past 50 year were extrap- olat back 150 year to the common ancestor with the avian viru NP , dkbav77 . such lengthi extrapol may be mislead ( 15 , 16 ) . the dispar in our estim aris becaus ( i ) our estim are base on nucleotid phyloge- nie and ( ii ) we attempt to estim onli the date of the immedi common ancestor for human and classic swine viru np and then evalu the relationship of that ancestor to those of avian viru np . We believ that more accur rate of evolut and date of common ancestor can be estim from nucleotid phylogeni . thi is becaus protein evolut is depend on nucleotid evolut and nucleotid sequenc contain much more inform to resolv ambigu relationship , particularli when a high proport of silent mutat occur ( e.g. , in avian viru lineag ) . moreov , becaus select act directli on the protein ( the phenotyp ) wherea the genet code is degen- erat , amino acid evolutionari rate may be less constant over time , particularli after a viru is introduc into a new host . dure thi earli adapt phase , select pressur on protein and their evolutionari rate are expect to be rel high . thu , linear extrapol of long-term amino acid evolutionari rate is expect to provid earlier estim of date of common ancestor . for exampl , on the basi ofamino acid evolutionari rate in our analysi , the common ancestor of human and classic swine viru np is estim to have appear in 1900 or 1905 , 7 to 13 year earlier than estim base on nucleotid evolutionari rate ( fig . 3 ) . the time frame given by gammelin et al . ( 13 ) for NP evolut suggest that the viru may have been in human for 75 year befor our estim diverg of human and classic swine virus in 1912 to 1913 . our analysi doe not support a long histori of NP evolut in mammalian host prior to 1912 . the intern branch that connect the human and swine NP amino acid lineag to the avian root ( between the upper and lower star in fig . 1B ) repres the chang in the common ancestor that are share by human and swine viru NP lineag . the close ofthi common ancestor to the avian root ( five amino acid chang , onli three of which are not share with ani avian NP [ fig . 2 ] ) suggest that thi ancestor NP had recent been acquir from an avian viru . comparison of the homolog intern branch in nucleo- tide and amino acid tree ( fig . 1 ) show that the bulk of the nucleotid chang are silent code chang ( coding-to- noncod ratio , 1:10.6 ) . In thi respect , the human-swin NP common ancestor is avianlik ; i.e. , evolutionari stasi of the protein limit code chang at the nucleotid level ( 15 , 16 ) . thi parallel suggest that the major of the nucleotid chang in thi common ancestor gene were inherit from an avian ancestor . differ in protein evolut between human and swine viru np are evid in the earliest viru isol and repres host-specif signatur of viru evolut . after diverg of human and swine NP lineag , the ratio of code to noncod chang in the human viru NP in- creas and remain stabl at 1:4.17 ( 1933 to 1983 mean ; ratio ofamino acid to nucleotid evolutionari rate regress slope - 1 [ fig . 3 ] ) , which indic a shift in gene evolut rel to the avianlik common ancestor ( fig . 1 ) . unlik evolutionari stasi among avian np , the human viru NP ha undergon rel rapid , diverg protein evolut which ha not abat over the 50 or more year human virus have been isol . In comparison , evolut in the swine lineag remain more avianlik ; i.e. , the swine viru NP protein ha evolv more slowli away from it avian ancestor , as indic by a smaller ratio of code to non- code chang ( 1930 to 1988 mean , 1:8.74 [ fig . 4 ] ) . diverg evolut in human and classic swine virus . the common ancestor for human and classic swine viru np mark the point where the evolut of the two virus diverg . that diverg reflect a split in the viru gene pool into human and swine host reservoir and show that the virus have evolv independ in each reservoir . It is appar that regular interspeci transmiss of human and swine virus ( see , e.g. , refer 7 , 10 , 19 , and 37 ) and exampl from thi report ( i.e. , nj76 , wis88 , swcam35 , swhk76 , and swdan83 ) have not affect viru evolut in the two host speci . thu , the continu diverg evolut of the virus in the two host reservoir suggest that there are as yet unidentifi factor that allow onli certain virus to persist , circul , and evolv in each host speci . the close of the human-swin common ances- tor to avian NP protein , the diverg and rapid parallel evolut of NP gene in human and swine virus , and the differ signatur of host-specif protein evolut in human and swine virus suggest that the avianlik ancestor could have circul for onli a short time in one of the two host reservoir befor enter the other . evolutionari diverg in human and classic swine virus is probabl relat to differ in immun protec- tion as it is relat to host popul age structur . human popul are character by older individu ( > 10 year ) with extens immunolog experi , wherea in swine popul young , immunolog naiv individu predomin . As a result of these differ , a newli establish viru would be subject to strong immun select pressur in human popul which would result in rapid evolut of viru antigen ; the revers would be expect for a viru in swine popul . follow estab- lishment of the same new viru in human and swine popu- lation , onli a small fraction ofhuman would continu to be suscept to the swine viru strain , and such case would not lead to epidem . On the other hand , pig could con- tinu to be infect with human viru strain , but it is appar that human-to-swin viru transmiss in north america over the past 60 year have not result in new persist swine viru strain or lineag ( fig . 1 ) . thi evolutionari model is appropri for the HA and NA surfac protein of influenza virus becaus they are the princip target of neutral antibodi ( 28 ) . howev , becaus the evolut of the intern NP protein is concor- dant with thi model , it is possibl that select pressur via t-cell immun respons ha affect the evolut of NP gene .

To account for histor record , coincid pandem and epizoot had to aris independ from virul strain in 1918 , which is not like . also , thi phylogeni requir a new human viru to circul and evolv for 6 year ( 1912 to 1918 ) without caus pandem . ( B ) diverg of multipl lineag of swine virus from a 1912 to 1913 common ancestor . Of the two surviv lineag , the one that give rise to classic swine virus also caus the human influenza pandem of 1918 , but present-day human virus are shown as be deriv from a sister lineag of swine virus . thi model requir multipl strain of swine virus to circul and evolv independ for 6 year or more after 1912 . thi pattern of earli evolut ha not yet been demonstr for recent avianlik swine virus . the propos post-1918 origin of human virus from a sister swine viru strain would requir higher pre-1933 evolutionari rate for human viru gene than is predict by assum a 1918 origin ( fig . 3 ) . ( C ) human and swine virus diverg from a common ancestor in 1918 . In thi model the classic swine virus are deriv from the 1918 human pandem viru . the pre-1918 host is unknown but could have been swine . thi phylogeni requir higher evolutionari rate for human and classic swine viru over the period from 1918 to the earli 1930 . howev , these estim rate are similar to those for the new avian-lik hlnl swine virus . graphic differ appear to have had littl impact on the evolut of NP gene ; the similar nucleotid evolutionari rate observ in the two host popul suggest that the virus may have similar replic ( and mutat ) rate . An import characterist of classic swine viru is that it ha circul and evolv in north american swine herd for more than 60 year . howev , when classic swine virus have been introduc into europ or asia , they usual have not persist for long period . the reason for thi pattern are not understood . the associ of classic swine virus with north america suggest a uniqu region ecolog which is probabl relat to differ in swine husbandri practic in north america , europ , and asia . A 1918 origin for hlnl human and classic swine virus ? the estim date of 1912 to 1913 for the common ancestor of human and swine virus ( fig . SA ) doe not agre with result of seroarcheolog studi that suggest that 1918 mark the appear of a new hlnl viru in the human popul ( see , e.g. , refer 27 ) , nor with 1918 histor record of a sever pandem of human influenza and epi- zootic of swine viru in north america ( 9 ) . An altern explan might be that a number of viru lineag may have diverg around 1912 to 1913 and the onli surviv lineag are those that now repres swine and human host ( e.g. , fig . 5B ) . A major assumpt in estim the date of the common ancestor is that evolutionari rate within a lineag remain constant from it origin . If 1918 is accept as the date for the diverg ofth human and swine viru NP lineag ( fig . 5C ) , evolutionari rate from 1918 to the earli 1930 were significantli higher than after that period . our evolutionari analysi suggest that human and classic swine virus origin from a common event and that the ancestor viru had onli a short prior exist in human or swine host reservoir . model for evolut of earli human and swine virus . evolut of recent avianlik hlnl swine virus in europ may serv as a model for evolut of earli human and classic swine virus . the NP gene of these avianlik virus have been evolv in the european swine host reservoir for some 10 year ( 1979 to 1989 ) at a higher rate than is observ for human or classic swine viru np ( 4.50 versu 3.41 and 3.31 nucleotid chang per year , respect [ fig . 3 ] ) . higher nucleotid evolutionari rate may be typic for an avian viru recent introduc into the swine host reservoir . If the evolutionari rate of the new avianlik swine viru np is appli to the human and classic swine viru lineag for the pre-1930 period , the estim date of the common ancestor is 1918 to 1919 . convers , if 1918 is assum as the date of the common ancestor , the predict initi evolutionari rate is 4.7 nucle- otid chang per year for human np ( between 1918 and 1933 ) and 4.75 chang per year for classic swine np ( between 1918 and 1930 ) . with thi modif , the pre- dict amino acid evolutionari rate for 1918 to 1930 classic swine viru np becom more similar to that of the recent avianlik swine viru np ( 0.9 versu 0.74 chang per year ) than to that of the pre-1930 human np ( 1.35 chang per year ) . the much higher predict evolutionari rate for earli human viru NP protein than for classic swine virus mirror the pattern for post-1930 human and classic swine virus ( fig . 3 ) . the parallel between pre-1930 classic swine viru np and the new avianlik swine viru np suggest that the swia30 isol is nearli as avianlik as the recent swit89 isol ; from the root of the avian lineag , swia30 ha diverg by 14 amino acid chang in 12 to 17 year and swit89 ha accumul 11 chang in 10 year . the unusu close agreement in the predict evolut of these human and swine viru np make a post-1912 date of origin for human and classic swine virus plausibl . An unusu aspect of evolut in the new avianlik swine viru np is that the rate of amino acid evolut is twice as high as that in classic swine virus while nucleotid J. virol . evolut OF human and swine hlnl virus 3713 evolut is onli 30 to 40 % higher ( fig . 3 ) . the dispropor- tional higher rate of NP protein evolut in the new avianlik swine virus compar with the classic swine virus suggest that they are under stronger select pres- sure , which , as discuss abov , is expect for new vi- ruse . the same situat would appli to pre-1930 classic swine virus if their date of origin is assum to be 1918 ( fig . 3 ) . A propos consist with our evolutionari analysi and histor record would be that an hlnl avianlik viru enter human or swine host a short time befor 1918 . In 1918 a virul strain of thi viru caus a sever human influenza pandem , and , as suggest by crosbi ( 9 ) , the human pandem viru wa subsequ introduc into north american swine popul , give rise to the clas- sical swine virus ( fig . SC ) . the suggest that classic swine viru wa deriv from the human pandem viru of 1918 doe not impli that swine did not play a role in the appear of thi new viru in the human popul . It is entir possibl that somewher in the world , swine may have serv as an intermedi host prior to the emerg of the 1918 pandem viru . clearli , such an event would be highli transitori and therefor imposs to detect in an evolutionari analysi . the potenti of avian virus to enter , circul , and evolv in the swine host reservoir is demonstr by the new avianlik swine virus in europ . the possibl that the 1918 viru wa not a reassort viru but an entir novel avianlik viru may be a contrib- ute factor to it virul , predict rapid evolut , and entranc into and persist in the swine host reservoir . A comparison of mortal figur show that the reassort pandem virus of 1957 and 1968 were appar milder than the highli virul 1918 viru ( 9 ) . there is evid that wide dissemin of human viru dure the 1968 pandem result in an increas incid of human virus isol from pig ( see , e.g. , refer 24 , 30 , and 49 ) . unlik the 1918 pandem viru , there is as yet no evid that the pandem virus of 1957 or 1968 result in new swine- specif strain that have persist to the present day . also , there is no evid that the pandem of 1957 and 1968 had ani detect effect on the evolut of np of human or classic swine virus ( fig . 1 and 4 ) . therefor , although new strain of swine virus may be expect to appear follow human pandem , few would be expect to persist and evolv in the swine host reservoir . the mode of interspeci transmiss of influenza virus or gene from the avian host reservoir to the human popu- lation remain unresolv . the 1957 and 1968 pandem virus origin from china , and there is anecdot evi- denc that 19th centuri pandem virus also origin from china ( 28 ) . humanlik and avianlik virus are regu- larli isol from pig in china , taiwan , and southeast asia ( 24 , 33 , 42 , 44 ) , but persist , wide circul , swine-specif strain compar to classic swine virus in north america or the new avianlik swine virus in europ have not been found . common orient agricultur practic place human , swine , and domest duck in close associ and enhanc the likelihood of interspeci trans- mission of influenza virus . further understand of the origin of human pandem virus will requir detail knowledg of the ecolog and evolut of human , swine , and avian influenza virus in a varieti of situat around the world where interspecif exchang are like . acknowledg We thank raphael onwuzuruigbo and evelyn stigger for techni- cal assist , clayton naev and the sjcrh molecular resourc center for prepar of oligonucleotid , and patricia eddi and the sjcrh molecular biolog comput facil for comput support . thi work wa support by u.s. public health research grant ai-29680 , nation institut of allergi and infecti diseas grant ai-29599 and ai-08831 , cancer center support ( core ) grant ca-21765 , nation research servic award 5t32-ca09346 to o.t.g. , and american lebanes syrian associ chariti . refer 1 . altmul , A. , W.
