To test whether overexpress of sia ( 2,6 ) gal moieti in cultur cell could make them suitabl for test human influenza viru sensit to nai , we stabli transfect mdck cell with cdna of human 2,6-sialyltransferas ( siat1 ) . transfect cell express twofold-high amount of 6-link sialic acid and twofold-low amount of 3-link sialic acid than parent mdck cell as judg by stain with sambucu nigra agglutinin and maackia amurensi agglutinin , respect . after transfect , bind of a clinic human influenza viru isol wa increas , wherea bind of it egg-adapt variant which preferenti bound 3-link receptor wa decreas . the sensit of human influenza A and B virus to the neuraminidas inhibitor oseltamivir carboxyl wa substanti improv in the siat1-transfect cell line and wa consist with their sensit in neur- aminidas enzym assay and with the hemagglutinin ( HA ) receptor-bind phenotyp . mdck cell stabli transfect with siat1 may therefor be a suitabl system for test influenza viru sensit to nai . the neuraminidas ( NA ) of influenza A and B virus cleav the -glycosid linkag between sialic acid and the adjac sugar and thu destroy viru receptor on the cell surfac , extracellular inhibitor , and viral glycoprotein ( re- view in refer 2 and 8 ) . the NA activ is believ to be particularli import at the late stage of infect by pre- vent hemagglutinin ( HA ) -mediat self-aggreg and fa- cilit releas of progeni virion from cell . interact of virion with cell-associ and solubl sialylglycoconjug of the host is mediat by HA and NA in an antagonist manner , which ha to be care balanc to allow effici viru rep- licat ( review in refer 36 ) . with increas use of neuraminidas inhibitor ( nai ) for influenza treatment , there is a need for a suitabl methodolog to monitor for emerg of viru resist ( 32 , 34 , 38 ) . In cell cultur experi , resist to nai result from muta- tion of either HA , NA , or both glycoprotein . mutat in HA usual preced NA mutat and reduc viru affin for sialic acid-contain receptor , therebi decreas the depen- denci of the viru on NA function , wherea mutat in NA decreas the bind affin of the inhibitor to the catalyt site ( review in refer 19 , 29 , and 30 ) . In a clinic set , na-medi resist seem to be the primari mechan of resist to nai and can be easili and reliabl monitor use an in vitro enzym inhibit assay ( 32 , 34 , 38 ) . sinc the possibl can not be exclud that the loss of sensit to nai in human occur also as a result of HA mutat ( 18 , 20 ) , it is necessari to develop techniqu to studi thi type of resis- tanc in low-passage-numb clinic isol . the method of choic for test viru sensit to nai would be a viru neutral assay in cell cultur that ac- count for both ha- and na-medi resist . howev , there is no good correl between viru sensit to nai in vivo and in laboratori cell cultur . the sensit of clinic viru isol to NA inhibitor can vari in cell cultur assay dramat ( up to complet insensit ) despit a uniform high sensit of the enzym in na-inhibit test ( 1 , 3,37 ) . thi problem is like due to a mismatch between viru recep- tor in human and in avail cell cultur system . the target cell for viru replic in human airway epithelium express high concentr of sia ( 2,6 ) gal-contain receptor and small amount of sia ( 2,3 ) gal-contain receptor ( below ab- breviat to 6-link and 3-link sialic acid receptor , respec- tive ) ( 4 , 9 ) . clinic isol of human influenza virus bind strongli to 6-link sialic acid but do not bind to 3-link sialic acid ( refer 13 and 21 and refer therein ) . It is therefor believ that in order to adequ assay human influenza viru sensit to nai , a cell line is requir which support effici growth of clinic influenza viru isol and express larg amount of 6-link sialic acid and small amount of 3-link sialic acid ( 38 ) . unfortun , the con- centrat of 6-link sialic acid in continu cell line use for propag of influenza virus in the laboratori ( such as mdck and vero cell ) is rel low and is compar to the concentr of 3-link sialic acid ( 16 , 21 , 33 ) .

To thi end , we perman transfect mdck cell with the gene of the human cmp-n- acetylneuramin beta-galactosid -2,6-sialyltransferas ( siat1 ) [ EC 2.4.99.1 ; other acronym use in the literatur are st6gal I and st6 ( N ) ] , an enzym that catalyz the -2,6- sialyl of n-acetyllactosamin moieti of glycoprotein and glycolipid ( see refer 11 and 35 for a review ) . base on previou report on success overexpress of siat1 in mammalian cell ( 6 , 10 , 12 , 24 , 25 ) , we expect that transfec- tion with siat1 would increas -2,6-sialyl of the cellular and viral glycoconjug and , thu , would increas a viru depend on a neuraminidas activ and , henc , sensit to NA inhibitor . furthermor , we hope that transfect would decreas -2,3-sialyl in the cell due to a competi- tion between siat1 and 2,3-specif sialyltransferas for the same precursor substrat [ gal ( 1,4 ) glcnac-r ] ( 6 , 24 ) . materi and method virus . clinic isol in mdck cell of a/memphis/14/96 ( h1n1 ) and b/memphis/25/99 at passag level 2 were kindli provid by robert webster ( st. jude children 's hospit ) . the memphis/14/96 viru wa plaqu in mdck cell ; two plaqu of differ size were pick , amplifi in mdck cell , and design variant M and M1 . In parallel , the origin passag 2 viru wa passag twice in embryon chicken egg . the viru progeni from two dif- ferent egg were plaqu purifi in mdck cell , amplifi in mdck cell , and design variant E and E1 . the complet HA gene of the variant were sequenc by the dideoxi method , use an automat sequenc ( perkin- elmer ) . the genbank access number for the sequenc are from ay282756 to ay282759 .

In thi studi , the origin and siat1-transfect cell were passag in dulbecco 's modifi eagl medium ( gibco brl ) supple- ment with 10 % fetal calf serum . express vector piresneo-siat1 and stabl transfect of mdck cell . the cdna clone of human siat1 in the pcdna3.1g express vector wa obtain from the genestorm human clone collect ( genestorm clone H- x17247 M ; invitrogen ) . the full-length open read frame of siat1 wa pcr amplifi with primer 5ggcgcaatagcggccgcgccaccatgattca caccaacctgaag-3 and 5ggccgatatggatccttagcagtgaat ggtccggaagccag-3 , contain restrict site for noti and bamhi , respect . the pcr product wa clone into the piresneo bicistron expres- sion vector ( clontech ) at 5 noti and 3 bamhi . sequenc of the initi prepar construct reveal a single-nucleotid delet in the code region of siat1 , lead to a frame shift ( plasmid piresneo-siat1-del ) . the delet wa locat in the region complementari to the 5-end pcr primer use and wa most like caus by an error dure primer synthesi . We correct the delet by use a quikchang site-direct mutagenesi kit ( stratagen ) . mdck cell were transfect with piresneo-siat1 and piresneo-siat1- del plasmid use lipofectamin 2000 ( life technolog ) accord to the manufactur 's instruct . transfect cultur were cultiv in the presenc of 1.5 mg of antibiot g418 sulfat ( promega ) /ml . after 2 week , cell surviv the select were pool , passag three time in 1.5 mg of g418/ml , and frozen in aliquot . serial passag of stabli transfect cell were done in the presenc of 1 mg of g418/ml . termin plate of the cell for the infect experi , isol of plasma membran , and lectin stain were perform without g418 . the cell in these experi were use at passag level from 5 to 30 start from the frozen cell stock . detect of 6-link and 3-link sialic acid . cell surfac express of sialic acid in two differ type of linkag wa quantifi by use digoxigenin ( dig ) -label lectin sambucu nigra agglutinin ( sna ) specif for 6-link sialic acid , maackia amurensi agglutinin ( maa ) specif for 3-link sialic acid , and either fluorescein isothiocyanate-label or peroxidase-label anti- dig antibodi from the dig-glycan differenti kit ( boehring mannheim , mannheim , germani ) . fluorescence-activ cell sorter ( fac ) analysi of the cell stain with lectin wa perform as describ previous ( 17 ) use a facscan fluorospectromet ( becton dickinson ) . for the solid-phas assay of lectin bind , plasma membran were isol from mdck and mdck- siat1 cell as describ previous ( 14 ) . membran prepar were sus- pend in phosphate-buff salin ( pb ) to a final protein concentr of 2 g/ml , and 0.05-ml aliquot were incub in the well of a polystyren 96-well micropl overnight at 4т░c . well incub with pb serv as a control of the background bind . the plate wa wash with pb and block with 0.1 ml of a 0.04 % solut of bovin serum albumin ( bsa ) in pb for 1 h at 37т░c . solut ( 0.05 ml each ) of dig-label lectin ( either sna [ 2 g/ml ] or maa [ 5 g/ml ] ) in lectin-bind buffer ( lbb ) ( 0.2 % bsa , 1 mM mg2 , ca2 , and mn2 in tris-buff salin [ pH 7.2 ] ) were incub in the well for 2 h at 4т░c . after wash with pb , the plate wa incub with 0.05 ml of peroxidase- label anti-dig antibodies/wel in lbb for 1 h at 4т░c . o-phenylenediamin wa use as a chromogen substrat . bind of viru to cell membran . viru attach to cell membran wa assay by use the micropl adsorpt method ( 14 ) . In brief , virus were clarifi by low-spe centrifug , pellet by high-spe centrifug through a 25 % sucros cushion , and resuspend in 0.1 M tris-hcl buffer ( pH 7.3 ) . ninety-six-wel plate coat with the cell membran and block as describ abov were incub with 0.05 ml of serial dilut virus in 0.5 % bsa-pb for 30 min at 37т░c . the plate were wash with ice-cold wash solut ( pbs-t ) ( 0.02 % tween 80 in pb ) and incub with sheep antiserum against influenza viru a/taiwan/1/86 ( h1n1 ) ( center for diseas control and prevent , atlanta , ga. ) for 1 h at 4т░c , follow by wash ( pbs-t ) and incub with peroxidase-label anti-sheep antibodi ( dako ) for an addi- tional hour at 4т░c . pb contain 1 % bsa and 0.05 % tween 80 wa use for the prepar of work dilut of immunoreag . the amount of bound conjug , which reflect the amount of the viru present in the well , wa quantifi use o-phenylenediamin as a substrat . the absorb at 490 nm wa measur , and the data were convert to scatchard plot ( a490 versu a490/c ) , where the concentr of the virus ( C ) wa express in hemagglu- tinat unit . the background viru bind to the noncoat block well did not exceed 0.02 optic unit and wa disregard . peroxidase-label resialyl fetuin . To prepar monospecif fetuin-horse- radish peroxidas ( hrp ) conjug contain either 6-linked- or 3-link sialic acid moieti , bovin asialofetuin ( sigma , st. loui , Mo . ) wa first conjug with hrp by use the period method ( 5 ) . solut in phosphat buffer ( 0.1 M , pH 7.0 ) contain 8 mg of asialofetuin-hrp conjugate/ml , 1.5 mM cmp- neu5ac ( boehring ) , 2 mM mgcl2 , and either 80 mU of -2,6-sialyltransferas from rat liver ( wako chemic ) /ml or 8.5 mU of rat recombin -2,3- ( N ) - sialyltransferas ( calbiochem ) /ml were incub at 37т░c for 20 h. resialyl conjug were dialyz against 0.1 M tris-hcl buffer ( pH 7.3 ) , dilut with an equal volum of glycerol , and store at 20т░c . bind affin assay . the bind of the hrp-label fetuin to the virus wa studi use a solid-phas assay , as describ previous ( 27 ) . In brief , virus adsorb in the well of 96-well eia micropl ( greiner ) were incu- bate with serial dilut of hrp-label resialyl fetuin in pb supple- ment with 0.02 % bsa , 0.02 % tween 80 , and a 2 M concentr of the neuraminidas inhibitor oseltamivir carboxyl . after incub for 1 h at 4т░c , the plate were wash with ice-cold pbs-t , and the amount of bound label fetuin-hrp wa quantifi by the peroxidas activ present in the well . the bind data were convert to a490/c versu a490 scatchard plot , arbitrarili take the concentr of fetuin-hrp stock for 1,000 u/ml . the associ constant of the virus-fetuin complex were determin from the slope of these plot . focu reduct assay . cell cultur in 96-well plate ( greiner ) were inocu- late with 0.05 ml of either infect medium ( IM ) ( 0.1 % bsa in dulbecco' modifi eagl medium ) or serial 10-fold dilut of oseltamivir carboxyl in IM ( concentr rang from 2 nM to 200 M ) /well . after that , 50 l/well of serial twofold viru dilut in IM were ad to cover a rang of multipl of infect ( moi ) from about 5 to 100 focus-form unit per well . tpck- trypsin ( final concentr , 1 g/ml ) wa ad simultan with the viru to provid for multicycl replic . after 24 to 48 h of incub at 35т░c , the cell were fix with 4 % paraformaldehyd for 1 h and permeabil with 0.2 % solut of triton x-100 in pb for 20 min . these and all subsequ treatment vol . 77 , 2003 alter OF influenza viru receptor IN mdck cell 8419 of the cell were perform at room temperatur . fix cultur were immuno- stain for the express of viral nucleoprotein by incub for 1 h with monoclon antibodi specif for the nucleoprotein of either influenza A viru ( kindli provid by alexand klimov at center for diseas control ) or influ- enza B viru ( serotec ) follow by 1 h of incub with peroxidase-label anti-mous antibodi ( sigma ) and 30 min of incub with precipitate-form- ing peroxidas substrat ( true blue ; kpl ) . ten-perc hors serum plu 0.05 % tween 80 in pb wa use for the prepar of work dilut of immu- noreag . stain plate were scan on a flatb scanner with the data acquir by adob photoshop 7.0 softwar . To compens for some occasion variat in the size and number of foci in individu well , we use two to four replic well per experiment point . nineti percent inhibitori concentr present in tabl 1 were estim by visual observ of cultur infect at a moi of 20 to 40 focus-form unit per well . these valu correspond to the lowest of the drug concentr use , which reduc the stain area in the well at least 10-fold . result transfect of mdck cell with siat1 alter surfac ex- pression of 6-link and 3-link sialic acid and enhanc bind of a human influenza viru . for the perman ex- pression of 2,6-sialyltransferas , we clone human siat1 cdna into the bicistron mammalian express vector piresneo . becaus thi vector express the gene of interest and an antibiot resist marker from the same mrna , nearli all coloni surviv the select pressur must stabli express the gene of interest ( 31 ) . therefor , after transfect of mdck cell with the piresneo-siat1 plasmid , we did not isol individu resist clone but pool sever clone which surviv the select with g418 sulfat . To compar the express of 3-link and 6-link sialic acid on the surfac of transfect and parent cell , we use the linkage-specif lectin sna and maa . fac analysi indic that transfect with the piresneo-siat1 plasmid enhanc express of 6-link sialic acid and simulta- neousli lower express of 3-link sialic acid ( fig . 1 , top panel ) . In a solid-phas lectin bind assay , the bind of sna to the plasma membran of transfect cell increas about twofold , and the bind of maa decreas by about 50 % ( fig . 1 , bottom panel ) . thi pattern of reactiv with lectin remain unchang after 25 passag of mdck- siat1 cell in the presenc of g418 ( data not shown ) , indi- cate that the sialyl phenotyp of the cell wa stabl . As a control , we use mdck cell perman transfect with a piresneo-siat1-del plasmid which contain a frame shift delet in the siat1 gene ( see materi and method ) . In thi case , as expect , the lectin bind assay reveal no differ between parent and transfect cell ( data not shown ) . To test whether chang in sialyl of siat1-transfect cell affect the strength of viru bind to these cell , we use two influenza virus with distinct receptor-bind phe- fig . 1 . bind of the linkage-specif lectin sna and maa to cell surfac receptor of siat1-transfect and parent mdck cell . top panel , mdck-siat1 cell ( shade profil ) and mdck cell ( open profil ) were incub with dig-label lectin follow by incub with fluorescein isothiocyanate-label anti-dig antibod- i and subject to fac analysi . bottom panel , prepar of cell plasma membran adsorb in the well of a 96-well plate were incub with dig-label lectin follow by incub with per- oxidase-label anti-dig-antibodi . the data repres ratio of ab- sorbenc in the well coat with membran of mdck-siat1 cell to those in well coat with membran of mdck cell . tabl 1 . receptor-bind characterist and sensit to oseltamivir carboxyl of HA variant of a/memphis/14/96 ( h1n1 ) variant amino acid substitut in the haa bind affinityc , kass ( ml/u ) sensit to oseltamivir carboxyl , ic90 ( M ) d 2,6-fetuin-hrp 2,3-fetuin-hrp 24 h 48 h M 3.3 0.10 0.046 0.021 0.1 1.0 M1 e156k 4.9 0.58 0.70 0.30 nde 0.01 E n129kb 4.8 0.60 0.48 0.20 0.01 ntf E1 q226r 0.09 0.02 0.85 0.31 100 100 a with respect to HA sequenc of variant M.

On the contrari , the egg-adapt mutant bound to transfect cell more weakli than to mdck cell ( fig . 2 , bottom panel ) , al- though the differ in bind wa less pronounc than in the case of M viru . transfect of mdck cell with siat1 increas sensitiv- iti of influenza virus to oseltamivir carboxyl in a cell cultur neutral assay . becaus influenza virus did not produc clearli visibl plaqu in mdck-siat1 cell , we use a focu reduct assay to compar viru sensit to NA inhibitor in the parent mdck cell and in the siat1-trans- fect cell . parallel cultur of two cell line in 96-well plate were infect with serial viru dilut in the presenc or absenc of oseltamivir carboxyl and immunostain for the express of viru nucleoprotein . the effect of the drug on viru spread in parent and transfect cell wa compar at moi which result in growth of about 15 to 50 foci of infect cell per well . In the first seri of experi , three clinic viru isol , a/sydney/5/97 ( h3n2 ) , a/memphis/14/ 96-m ( h1n1 ) , and b/memphis/25/99 , were test . all three virus display a higher sensit to oseltamivir carboxyl in mdck-siat1 cell than in nontransfect cell . thi pat- tern of sensit wa reproduc in replic assay per- form on differ day . result of one repres exper- iment are shown in fig . 3 . In mdck-siat1 cell , 0.001 , 0.01 , and 0.1 M concentr of the drug markedli decreas the size of infecti foci form by h3n2 , h1n1 , and type B virus , respect . A further 10-fold increas in the respec- tive drug concentr complet abolish viru spread in transfect cell , as judg by the disappear of the comet- like foci of infect . By contrast , even the highest drug con- centrat did not complet inhibit format of foci in mdck cell . thu , mdck-siat1 cell provid a more sensi- tive system than mdck cell for test the suscept of human influenza A and B virus to nai . To check whether a focu reduct assay with mdck- siat1 cell could clearli identifi virus with drug-resist mutat in NA , we compar two drug-sensit clinic viru isol with their oseltamivir treatment-select drug-resis- tant mutant ( fig . 4 ) .

By contrast , a 100-fold-high con- centrat of the drug ( 10 M ) wa requir for a detect inhibit of the drug-resist variant with an r292k muta- tion in NA . interestingli , the infecti foci of the mutant in the absenc of the drug were smaller that those of the wild-typ viru , suggest that the NA mutat impair spread of the viru in mdck-siat1 cell . thi effect is consist with the report compromis infect of the r292k NA mutant in vivo ( 7 ) . becaus of a slower spread of the NA mutant , thi viru produc veri small foci 24 h postinfect , make it imposs to assess a reduct in focu size in the presenc of NA inhibitor ( data not shown ) . To solv thi problem , we use longer infect time for comparison of wild-typ virus and NA mutant . It ha to be mention that an increas in the incub time result in an appar decreas in the viru sensit to the inhibitor . for exampl , 0.001 and 0.1 M concentr of the drug were requir , respect , for a substanti inhibit of wild-typ viru spread dure 24 h ( fig . 3 ) and 40 h of infect ( fig . 4a ) . thu , standard of the assay time will be import for routin drug sensit monitor use a focu reduct assay . figur 4b show the result obtain with anoth pair of pre- and posttreat h3n2 virus which were test in parallel in two cell line . In mdck cell , neither viru is drug sensit , make it imposs to discrimin between resis- tant mutant and the origin viru . howev , in mdck-siat1 cell , the wild-typ viru can be clearli differenti from it drug-resist mutant with an e119v mutat in the NA . thu , experi with two pre- and posttreat viru pair test suggest that na-medi drug resist can be reliabl detect in siat1-transfect cell . sensit to NA inhibitor in mdck-siat1 cell correl with viru affin for 6-link sialic acid . To address the question of whether ha-medi drug resist could be adequ assay in mdck-siat1 cell , we need a panel of viru variant which differ by the receptor-bind charac- terist of their ha . To gener such variant , we select two receptor-bind mutant ( E and E1 ) of the clinic h1n1 viru isol a/memphis/14/96 by adapt of the viru to embryon hen 's egg . furthermor , dure the plaqu pu- rific of the origin human viru in mdck cell , two mdck-deriv variant were obtain , M and M1 . the com- plete HA gene of four viru variant were sequenc , and their receptor-bind characterist were determin use resialyl fetuin , which carri either 3- or 6-link sialic acid ( tabl 1 ) . among both mdck-deriv virus , onli variant M dis- play a typic receptor-bind phenotyp of clinic human isol , name , a high affin for 6-link sialic acid and a lack of bind to 3-link sialic acid ( 13 , 15 ) . variant M1 differ from variant M by the amino acid substitut e156k , which increas a posit charg of the globular head of HA by two unit of charg and enhanc the viru bind affin for both 3-link and 6-link sialic acid . analysi of the HA sequenc in the influenza sequenc databas ( 26 ) indic that the a/memphis/14/96 strain use in thi studi wa phylo- genet close relat to h1n1 virus isol in 1995 to 1996 . among about 30 H1 HA sequenc from thi time pe- riod , three sequenc carri 156g and the rest carri 156e . furthermor , none of more than a hundr human h1n1 virus isol between 1995 and 2001 contain 156k . base on the result of sequenc comparison and on receptor-bind characterist , we conclud that variant M repres the orig- inal clinic human viru , wherea M1 is a receptor-bind mutant select in mdck cell . egg adapt of human virus is base on select of HA mutant with enhanc affin for 3-link sialic acid and , as a rule , lead to accompani chang in the affin for 6-link sialic acid ( 13 , 15 , 21 ) . accordingli , the egg-adapt variant E and E1 demonstr significantli enhanc bind to fetuin carri 3-link sialic acid compar to the bind of the origin M variant ( tabl 1 ) . In the case of variant E , the HA mutat n129k , respons for the adapt , increas the posit charg of HA , destroy a glycosyl sequon near the receptor bind site , and enhanc the viru affin for both 3-link and 6-link sialic acid . By contrast , substi- tution q226r in E1 almost complet destroy the abil of the viru to bind to 6-link receptor . interestingli , the amino acid in posit 226 is crucial for the recognit of the sia-gal linkag by H2 and H3 subtyp ha ( refer 28 and refer- enc therein ) . the E1 variant describ here provid the first exampl of a similar role of the 226 posit in an h1n1 human viru . We next compar four receptor-bind variant for their sensit to oseltamivir carboxyl in mdck-siat1 cell ( tabl 1 ) . In the first experi , the cell were fix 24 h after fig . 4 . comparison of clinic isol ( wt ) and their drug-resist variant with NA mutat ( mut ) by focu reduct assay .

J. virol . infect . under these condit , 0.1 and 0.01 M concentra- tion of the drug were requir to inhibit the spread of M and E variant by 90 % , respect , wherea E1 viru wa not inhibit to ani signific extent at the highest concentr of oseltamivir carboxyl test ( 100 M ) . becaus the M1 variant produc veri tini foci 24 h postinfect , preclud unambigu detect of inhibit , the assay wa repeat for M , M1 , and E1 virus use a 48-h incub time . In thi case , the M1 variant wa 100-fold more sensit to the NA inhibitor than the origin M viru . togeth these result indic that the sensit of the virus to the drug in mdck-siat1 cell wa mainli depend on viru affin for 6-link rather than for 3-link sialic acid receptor . name , E and M1 mutant with enhanc bind affin for 6-link receptor were more sensit to oseltamivir carboxyl than the wild-typ viru , wherea the E1 variant wa complet resist , in correl with it inabl to bind to 6-link sialic acid and despit it highest affin for 3-link sialic acid . It seem , howev , that the viru affin for 3-link receptor could somewhat modifi it suscept to the drug . thu , a high sensit to oseltamivir of the M1 variant com- pare to that of the E variant correl with a higher affin of the former viru for 2,3-fetuin . discuss low-passage-numb clinic influenza viru isol often appear insensit to nai when test in mdck or other laboratori cell line . thi preclud the detect of chang in viral drug sensit ( resist ) between pre- and posttreat- ment isol and can give rise to false-posit identif of resist in popul screen . thi studi wa undertaken to test whether a genet engin increas in the densiti of human influenza viru receptor on the surfac of mdck cell can make the viru more sensit to nai in these cell . To address thi question , we perman transfect mdck cell with the gene of human 2,6-sialyltransferas . stabl transfect with the siat1 gene increas the con- centrat of 6-link sialic acid on the surfac of mdck cell about twofold . thi effect is consist with enhanc -2,6- sialyl in sever other mammalian cell line after their transfect with siat1 ( 6 , 10 , 12 , 24 , 25 ) . We found that a typic non-egg-adapt human h1n1 influenza viru bound more strongli to transfect cell than to parent mdck cell . thi result confirm that express of siat1 enhanc the concentr of 6-link sialic acid receptor access to the viru on a cell surfac . siat1 catalys synthesi of 6-sialyl ( n-acetyllactosamin ) [ neu5ac ( 2,6 ) gal ( 1,4 ) glcnac ] , the common high-affin receptor determin of human influ- enza A and B virus ( 13 ) . We specul , therefor , that all human influenza virus irrespect of their type and subtyp will like display enhanc bind to mdck-siat1 . repres clinic isol of h1n1 and h3n2 influ- enza A virus and type B virus were substanti more sensit to the NA inhibitor oseltamivir carboxyl in siat1- transfect cell than in parent cell . these data support the hypothesi that the well-known low sensit of clinic iso- late of human virus to nai in mdck cell is due to a low express of 6-link viru receptor in these cell ( 19 , 30 , 38 ) . there are at least two possibl mechan by which increas -2,6-sialyl in the cell enhanc viru sensit to nai . first , due to an increas densiti of 6-link cell-surfac sialic acid , progeni virion attach more strongli to the surfac of mdck-siat1 cell and henc requir a higher neuraminidas activ for receptor cleavag and viru releas . second , en- hanc activ of siat1 in the cell can lead to an increas -2,6-sialyl of the viral glycoprotein . As a consequ , a higher level of NA activ would be need to desialyl viral HA and NA to a degre that prevent self-aggreg of the progeni virion . thu , our result suggest that transfect with siat1 may solv or at least reduc the major problem which hamper util of mdck cell for a neutral assay of viru sensit to nai ( 38 ) . In addit to the low sensit of clinic human virus to nai in standard laboratori cell potenti give false-posi- tive resist result ( 3 , 37 ) , false-neg resist result in mdck cell were also report ( 18 , 20 ) . for exampl , an influenza B viru isol recov from an immunocompro- mise child after 12 day of treatment with zanamivir wa highli sensit to the drug in mdck cell despit a drug- resist phenotyp in the NA enzym inhibit assay ( 18 ) . compar to the pretreat isol , thi viru had a drug- resist mutat in the NA catalyt site ( r152k ) and a mutat in the region of the HA receptor-bind site ( t198i ) . the HA mutat increas the viru bind to 3-link receptor and , as a result , to mdck cell which ex- press high quantiti of 3-link sialic acid ( 21 , 33 ) . enhanc bind to cell increas the viru depend on the NA activ , therebi mask the drug-resist effect of the NA mutat . these data suggest that laboratori cell do not adequ mimic viru infect of airway epithelium in vivo , not onli becaus of a lower level of express of 6-link sialic acid but also becaus of a higher concentr of 3-link receptor . If thi hypothesi is correct , a reduc express of 3-link sialic acid in laboratori cell would be desir for adequ test of viru sensit to nai . In view of thi hypothesi , we hope that perman express of the siat1 gene in mdck cell could decreas -2,3-sialyl in these cell due to competit between siat1 and -2,3-sialyltrans- feras which util the same substrat [ gal ( 1,4 ) glcnac ] ( for exampl , st3gal iii and st3gal IV [ 35 ] ) . the maa which we use to determin chang in express of 3-link sialic acid select bind to neu5ac/gc ( 2,3 ) gal ( 1,4 ) gl- cnac moieti synthes by st3gal iii and st3gal IV ( 23 ) . As we expect , the concentr of these moieti in the siat1-transfect cell decreas by about 50 % . howev , becaus one can not expect a competit between siat1 and -2,3-sialyltransferas with differ substrat specif [ such as st3gal I and st3gal II , which sialyl gal ( 1,3 ) galnac ] , the total decreas in express of 3-link sialic acid in all possibl context wa certainli less than that deter- mine with maa . thi notion may explain whi we observ a rel margin decreas in bind of an egg-adapt hu- man viru to mdck-siat1 cell . although NA mutat appear to be the major mechan of influenza viru resist to nai in a clinic set ( 32 , 34 , 38 ) , the possibl that resist emerg due to mutat in HA can not be complet exclud . thu , in a studi cite abov , the HA mutat t198i in influenza B viru wa first observ after 8 day of treatment with zanamivir , at least 4 vol . 77 , 2003 alter OF influenza viru receptor IN mdck cell 8423 day befor the emerg of a drug resist mutat in NA ( 18 ) . the substitut t198i wa found to lower substanti the HA affin for 6-link sialic acid receptor . the author suggest that thi mutat result in a decreas viru bind- ing to human airway epitheli cell ( where 6-link receptor predomin ) and thu reduc depend of viru replica- tion on the NA function in human ( ha-medi resist to nai ) . support to thi concept came from the studi in which volunt who were experiment infect with egg-adapt human h1n1 viru and treat with oseltamivir were moni- tore for the emerg of drug-resist virus by pheno- typic assay and sequenc of HA and NA ( 20 ) . due to it passag in egg , the origin viru inoculum repres a heterogen mixtur of receptor-bind variant differ by amino acid substitut in HA . In the last-day isol from volunt , the ratio of the variant chang from that in the inoculum . In the placebo group , variant with a higher affin for 6-link receptor predomin over the egg-deriv low- affin variant with typic egg adapt mutat in HA . By contrast , in drug-treat group revers of the egg-de- rive variant to the non-egg-adapt genotyp wa inhibit . these data suggest that virus with a lower affin for 6-link sialic acid receptor , such as egg-adapt variant of clinic human isol , can be less sensit to nai in vivo than origin non-egg-adapt virus . base on these result , it is current believ that HA mutat decreas viru affin for 6-link sialic acid may be a primari mechan of the ha-medi resist to NA inhibitor in human . To studi ha-medi viru resist to nai in mdck- siat1 cell , we compar a clinic human viru with it three laboratory-deriv receptor bind variant , which differ from the parent viru by singl amino acid substitut in HA . the sensit of the virus to oseltamivir carboxyl corre- late with their affin for 6-link sialic acid rather than for 3-link sialic acid . thi result suggest that neutral assay in mdck-siat1 have the potenti to adequ ac- count for the ha-medi resist in human . howev , virus with known ha-medi resist in vivo have to be test in thi assay to check whether thi assumpt is correct . In summari , by stabl transfect of the siat1 gene we were abl to make the spectrum of the sialic acid receptor in mdck cell more similar to that of human airway epithelium . the sensit of human influenza A and B virus to neur- aminidas inhibitor in mdck-siat1 cell wa increas and wa consist with their sensit in the NA enzym assay and with the HA receptor-bind phenotyp . these featur make mdck-siat1 cell a promis system for test sen- sitiv of influenza viru to nai . acknowledg m.m. , t.m. , and h.-d.k . were support by roch product ltd. , welwyn garden citi , unit kingdom .
