To our knowledg , thi is the first report of interspeci transmiss of an avian h4n8 influenza viru to domest pig under natur condit . influenza A viru can infect variou host , includ migratori waterfowl , resid bird , hors , swine , dog , sea mammal , and human . among these speci , swine serv as an import compon of the human-anim interfac and play an import role in influenza evolut and ecolog ( 2 ) . although pig can be simultan infect with avian influenza virus and human influenza virus , the virus can exchang gene and produc new variant , which suggest that pig have becom mix vessel for influenza virus ( 3 ) . howev , in natur , interspeci transmis- sion of avian virus to pig is not often document ( 1 ) . In octob 2011 , an avian-lik h4n8 swine influenza viru wa isol from a commerci pig farm dure an outbreak of sever respiratori diseas in pig in guangdong provinc , southern china . the strain had hemagglutin ( HA ) activ , and the HA titer rang from 128 to 256 . subsequ , nucleotid se- quenc of the eight viral gene were amplifi through revers transcriptas pcr ( rt-pcr ) . the amplifi product were puri- fie and clone into the pmd18-t vector ( takara ) and se- quenc with an abi 3730 XL genom sequenc . sequenc were assembl and manual edit to produc the final genom se- quenc . the strain wa identifi as subtyp h4n8 . the result show that the viru wa avian-lik h4n8 swine influenza viru , whose HA gene had the highest homolog with that of a/avian/japan/8k10185/2008 ( h4n6 ) ( 99 % ) and whose NA gene had the highest homolog with that of a/chicken/ guangxi/2117/2010 ( h3n8 ) ( 98 % ) . the NP gene wa phyloge- netic close to those in h5n1 avian influenza virus . accord- ingli , the nomenclatur for thi isol wa a/swine/guangdong/ k4/2011 ( h4n8 ) . phylogenet analys of the sequenc of all eight viral rna segment demonstr that these are wholli avian influenza virus of the asia lineag . the nucleotid se- quenc ident between each segment of a/swine/guangdong/ k4/2011 ( h4n8 ) and it potenti progenitor identifi in the public databas vari from 97 % to 99 % . find an NP gene fragment ostens of avian influenza ( h5n1 ) viru in thi strain impli that subtyp h5n1 virus may be abl to contribut gene to viru pathogen process in pig in southern china . the amino acid sequenc at the cleavag site in the HA mole- cule is pekasr/glf , indic that it is a low-pathogen avian influenza viru . analysi of potenti n-glycosyl site of HA protein show that thi viru ha four potenti n-glycosyla- tion site at posit 18 , 34 , 178 , and 310 . thi viru ha q226 and g228 ( H3 number ) in the receptor-bind site in the HA pro- tein , which preferenti bind to an avian-origin receptor . the analysi of pb2 protein show that it ha 627e and 701d , with no substitut . In the past decad , mani influenza pandem strain were report to emerg in southern china . thi is the first report of avian-lik h4n8 swine influenza viru contain an h5n1 avian influenza viru segment in southern china . thi find further confirm that thi area is critic for the emerg of novel influ- enza A virus . nucleotid sequenc access number . the genbank ac- cession number of a/swine/guangdong/k4/2011 ( h4n8 ) are jx151007 to jx151014 . acknowledg thi work wa support by the intern sci & tech cooper program ( 2010dfb33920 ) and the modern agricultur industri tech- nolog system ( cars-36 ) . the fund organ had no role in the studi design , data col- lection and analysi , ownership of the materi , or prepar of the manuscript . refer 1 . peiri jsm , et al . 2001 . cocircul of avian h9n2 and contemporari '' human '' h3n2 influenza A virus in pig in southeastern china : potenti for genet reassort ?
