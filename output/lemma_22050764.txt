It wa noteworthi that the newli identifi genotyp b65 ha been preval in china sinc 2007 , and more importantli , differ h9n2 influenza virus display a divers pathogen to mice . the isol of the 2008-2010 epidem ( genotyp b55 and b65 ) were lowli infecti , while two repres virus of genotyp B0 and G2 isol from the late 1990 were highli pathogen to mice . In addit , ck/sd/ly-1/08 ( genotyp 63 , contain h5n1-like NP and PA gene ) wa abl to replic well in mous lung with high viru titer but caus mild clinic sign . conclus : sever line of evid indic that the h9n2 influenza virus constantli chang their genet and pathogen . thu , the genet evolut of h9n2 virus and their pathogen to mammal should be close monitor to prevent the emerg of novel pandem virus . keyword : avian influenza viru , h9n2 , reassort , genotyp , pathogen background h9n2 influenza virus are panzoot in bird worldwid . statist analysi of the host rang and locat of h9n2 subtyp influenza A virus in the ncbi databas accord to HA gene reveal that approxim 60 % of all the h9n2 influenza virus were isol from chicken , with the remaind from wild bird ( 16.8 % ) , duck ( 8.9 % ) , turkey ( 6.7 % ) , and other domest avian popul ( 3.7 % ) ( data not shown ) . In addit , the overwhelm major ( 94.2 % ) of h9n2 influenza virus were isol in asia , with > 65 % come from mainland and hong kong of china ( data not shown ) . sinc in china the h9n2 viru wa first time isol in 1994 while approxim 74 differ genotyp have been observ till now and new lineag and genotyp continu identifi throughout china [ 1 ] . two main distinct lineag of h9n2 influenza virus repres by a/chicken/beijing/1/94 ( ck/bei-lik ) and a/quail/ hong kong/g1/97 ( g1-like ) have becom endem in china sinc the mid-1990 [ 2-5 ] . the g1-like virus were mainli detect in quail of southern china [ 3,4 ] . while , the ck/bei-lik virus were first preval among chicken , duck , and other minor poultri speci in both southern and northern china [ 4,5 ] and then were gradu- alli replac by the f98-like ( repres by a/chicken/ * correspond : sunlei362 @ im.ac.cn ; liuwj @ im.ac.cn contribut equal 1 center for molecular virolog , key laboratori of pathogen microbiolog and immunolog , institut of microbiolog , chines academi of scienc , beij 100101 , china full list of author inform is avail at the end of the articl Bi et al . virolog journal 2011 , 8:505 http : //www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/505 Â© 2011 Bi et al ; license biom central ltd . thi is an open access articl distribut under the term of the creativ common attribut licens ( http : //creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0 ) , which permit unrestrict use , distribut , and reproduct in ani medium , provid the origin work is properli cite . shanghai/f/98 ) virus sinc 2000 onward [ 5,6 ] . these virus evolv from the ck/bei-lik lineag but repli- cate and transmit more effect than the antece- dent virus in chicken under experiment condit [ 5 ] . recent studi reveal that most of the virus origi- nate from the ck/bei-lik virus and form multipl genotyp through complic reassort with g1-like , g9-like ( repres by a/chicken/hong kong/ g9/97 ) , y439-like ( repres by a/duck/hong kong/ y439/97 ) , and f98-like virus [ 2 ] . In order to systemat analyz the evolut of h9n2 influenza virus , the genealog of h9n2 virus wa further studi . In earli report , the method of genealog classif were mainli determin on the basi of genet relationship of all the eight gene segment with repres strain , such as ck/bj/1/94 , ck/sh/f/98 , qa/hk/g1/97 [ 2,7 ] . later , the h9n2 influenza virus iso- late in southern china were classifi into A ( virus with a g1-like HA ) and B ( virus with a ck/bei-lik HA ) genotyp seri with differ sourc and gene constella- tion [ 3,4 ] . On these basi , the h9n2 virus were further divid into seven differ seri ( A ~ G ) accord to their HA lineag . and in each seri , differ genotyp were design sequenti by addit 0 , 1 , 2 and so on , accord to their systemat nomenclatur [ 1,3,4 ] . for exampl , in genotyp B seri , non-reassort ck/ bei-lik virus were design as B0 , while reassort ck/bei-lik virus were design sequenti as B1 , B2 , and so on , accord to when the novel genotyp wa first identifi [ 1 ] . the nomenclatur system systemat unifi the lineag and genotyp of h9n2 influenza virus , which reveal the phylogenet divers and gen- otyp complex of h9n2 influenza virus worldwid [ 1 ] . the high evolut rate with complic reassort- ment prompt that h9n2 viru may threat to human health by genet contribut to the gener of novel pandem influenza viru . A recent studi highlight the import and risk of H9 reassort between avian h9n2 viru and the pandem h1n1/2009 influenza viru exhibit higher pathogen to mice than both the par- ental virus [ 8 ] . In fact , h9n2 virus have sporad cross the barrier from bird to mammal and sever recent emerg f98-like virus were suspect to have high pathogen to mice [ 9 ] . notic , h9n2 viru ha caus sever human infect with mild respiratori dis- eas in hong kong and mainland of china sinc 1997 [ 10 ] . moreov , some h9n2 virus isol from live bird market in hong kong , with leu ( L ) residu at amino acid posit 226 ( number by H3 ) in hemagglutinin ( HA ) receptor bind site ( rb ) , display human virus-lik receptor specif [ 11 ] . further studi reveal that the leu226 ( number by H3 ) in HA gene wa found to be import for the transmiss of the h9n2 virus in ferret , and mix the surfac glycoprotein of an h9n2 viru with the intern gene of an human h3n2 viru result in enhanc replic and effici direct trans- mission in ferret [ 12 ] . these result rais great concern about viral evolut and suggest that the h9n2 avian viru could be of pandem import . result phylogenet analysi eight gene segment of the 15 isol were phylogeneti- calli analyz togeth against the full length sequenc of 379 repres virus in china . the phylogenet tree of HA gene segment demonstr that the ck/bei-lik wa the predomin lineag and could be separ into four sub-lineag in china ( addit file 1 , figure.s1a ) . the g9-like sub-lineag and the f98-like sub-lineag were prevail around the year 2000 . wherea the js98-like virus ( repres by a/ckichen/jiangsu/1/98 ) circul from 2000 to 2005 , and the y280-like sub-lineag ( repre- sent by a/duck/hong kong/y280/97 ) , which compos the major of h9n2 influenza virus , ha circul in the recent 5 year ( addit file 1 , figure.s1a ) . In the present studi , the 13 virus isol from 2007 to 2010 fell into the y280-like sub-lineag , and ck/sd/wf/98 belong to the g9-like cluster ( tabl 1 and addit file 1 , figure.s1a ) . interestingli , the ck/hlj/u/98 isol display high ident ( 99.4 % ) with ck/hlj/35/00 [ gen- bank : dq064366 ] , which belong to the ty/wi/1/66-lik north american lineag ( addit file 1 , figure.s1a ) . A similar phylogenet structur wa seen in NA gene , but in contrast to HA , the NA gene of the ck/bei-lik lineag could be divid into three major subgroup : f98- , g9- , and y280-like ( addit file 1 , figure.s1b ) . most of the isol were in the y280-like sub-lineag , while ck/sd/ lx929/07 , ck/sd/lx1023/07 and ck/hlj/u/98 group with g9-like virus ( tabl 1 and addit file 1 , figur . s1b ) , which did not contain a stalk delet ( addit file 2 , tabl S1 ) . It wa also noteworthi that a human h9n2 isol a/guangzhou/333/99 [ genbank : ay043024 ] share high ident ( 98.3 % ) and form a sister cluster with ck/hlj/u/98 ( addit file 1 , figure.s1b ) . the M gene of ck/bei-lik and g1-like lineag were predomin in h9n2 virus ( addit file 1 , figur . s1c ) . and the g1-like M gene wa more preval than that of other gene segment and wa clearli separ into three sub-lineag among differ period of time ( addit file 1 , figure.s1c ) . ten of the eleven 2008- 2010 isol fell into the same g1-like lineag , while the other five isol group into the ck/bei-lik branch ( tabl 1 and addit file 1 , figure.s1c ) . the phyloge- netic tree of NS gene display that all the 15 isol group into the ck/bei-lik lineag , which predomi- nate in china and gener three sub-lineag ( addi- tional file 1 , figure.s1d ) . most of the 2008-2010 isol Bi et al . virolog journal 2011 , 8:505 http : //www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/505 page 2 of 11 belong to the f98-like group , while except ck/sd/wf/ 98 wa in the ck/bei-lik cluster , the other four virus cluster into the sh96-like group , which repres by a/quail/shanghai/8/96 ( tabl 1 and addit file 1 , figure.s1d ) . concern the pb2 gene , chines h9n2 virus mainli fell into three differ lineag : ck/bei- , f98- , and g1-like ( addit file 1 , figure.s1 ) . interestingli , seven isol togeth with other six 2007-2010 virus from genbank , form a novel independ lineag that origin from an unknown sourc and were genet adjac to the g1-like cluster ( name as h-like lineag , repres by a/chicken/shandong/h/09 ) ( tabl 1 and addit file 1 , figure.s1 ) . a/swine/yangzhou/1/2008 ( h9n2 ) [ genbank : hm998919 ] also locat into thi new cluster ( addit file 1 , figure.s1 ) . analysi of the pb1 gene reveal that china h9n2 virus could also be separ into three major lineag . the virus isol sinc 2008 in thi studi mainli belong to the f98-like lineag , while other earli isol cluster into the ck/bei-lik lineag , and the ck/hlj/u/98 belong to the g1-like lineag ( tabl 1 and addit file 1 , figure.s1f ) . the topolog of the PA and NP gene segment were similar with the pb1 gene , and the major of the 15 h9n2 isol locat in the f98-like lineag . for the PA gene , most of the isol from 2008 to 2010 cluster in the f98-like group , while two earli isol ( ck/sd/wf/98 and ck/hlj/u/98 ) fell into the ck/bei-lik and g1-like lineag , respect . two isol , ck/sd/lx929/07 and ck/sd/lx1023/07 , belong to the y439-like lineag , which wa an establish h9n2 lineag origin from h5n1-like viru ( addit file 1 , figure.s1g ) . impor- tantli , ck/sd/ly-1/08 contain h5n1-origin PA and NP gene . the NP gene of the h9n2 isol mainli group with the f98-like virus . howev , the NP gene of ck/hlj/u/98 and ck/sd/wf/98 belong to the ty/wi/1/66-lik north america lineag and the ck/bei- like lineag , respect ( tabl 1 and addit file 1 , figure.s1h ) . genotyp analysi In the present studi , the 15 h9n2 isol were further classifi into seven genotyp accord to the systemat and effect method of genotyp classif defin in previou studi [ 1 ] . six genotyp were ck/bei-lik ( geno- type B0 , b55 , b62 , b63 , b64 and b65 ) , and one genotyp wa ty/wi/1/66-lik ( genotyp G2 ) ( figur 1 , tabl 1 ) . ck/sd/wf/98 wa a typic ck/bei-lik viru with non- reassort and therefor classifi into the genotyp B0 group . two isol ( ck/sd/bd/08 and ck/sd/kd/09 ) origin from the f98-like lineag and the M gene came from the g1-like lineag , belong to genotyp b55 which contain virus frequent isol in recent year [ 9,13 ] . four novel h9n2 genotyp identifi in thi studi were design as b62 , b63 , b64 and b65 . genotyp b62 virus ( ck/sd/lx929/07 and ck/sd/lx1023/07 ) were quintupl reassort with ck/bei- , f98- , g9- , y439- like and sh96-like virus , which origin from ck/ bei-lik and had f98-like pb2 gene , g9-like NA gene , tabl 1 gene constel of differ genotyp of the h9n2 aiv viru genotyp genet source* pb2 pb1 PA HA NP NA M NS ck/sd/wf/98 B0 bj94 bj94 bj94 G9 bj94 y280 bj94 bj94 ck/hlj/u/98 G2 G1 G1 G1 nor A nor A G9 bj94 sh96 ck/sd/lx929/07 b62 f98 bj94 y439 y280 f98 G9 bj94 sh96 ck/sd/lx1023/07 b62 f98 bj94 y439 y280 f98 G9 bj94 sh96 ck/sd/ly-1/08 b63 f98 bj94 h5n1 y280 h5n1 y280 bj94 sh96 ck/sd/bd/08 b55 f98 f98 f98 y280 f98 y280 G1 f98 ck/sd/kd/09 b55 f98 f98 f98 y280 f98 y280 G1 f98 ck/sd/02/08 b64 f98 bj94 f98 y280 f98 y280 G1 f98 ck/sd/01/09 b65 H f98 f98 y280 f98 y280 G1 f98 ck/sd/02/09 b65 H f98 f98 y280 f98 y280 G1 f98 ck/sd/h/09 b65 H f98 f98 y280 f98 y280 G1 f98 ck/sd/bd/10 b65 H f98 f98 y280 f98 y280 G1 f98 ck/sd/01/10 b65 H f98 f98 y280 f98 y280 G1 f98 ck/sd/02/10 b65 H f98 f98 y280 f98 y280 G1 f98 ck/sd/03/10 b65 H f98 f98 y280 f98 y280 G1 f98 * PB , polymeras basic protein ;

Bi et al . virolog journal 2011 , 8:505 http : //www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/505 page 6 of 11 howev , further sequenc data collect is need to confirm if they are transient reassort or have been establish in avian . h9n2 influenza virus can also gener novel reassort- ment or genotyp virus that carri gene segment with wide evolutionari distanc . It ha been report that h9n2 strain a/swine/korea/s190/2004 wa a reassort between a eurasian lineag and a north american lineag virus [ 1 ] . In china , ck/hlj/35/00 ha onli been report as h9n2 viru that possess HA [ genbank : dq064366 ] and NP [ genbank : dq064447 ] gene from an earli north american lineag ( repres by ty/wi/1/ 66 ) [ 1,2 ] . interestingli howev , the ck/hlj/u/98 isol analyz in our studi possess each of eight gene seg- ment with the highest homolog to those of ck/hlj/35/ 00 ( addit file 1 , figure.s1 ) . these find suggest that the two strain might have the same origin , and thi genotyp wa not transient rather circul in china for sever year . the novel h9n2 reassort or genotyp with wide evolutionari distanc not onli gener by hybrid among differ lineag of h9n2 virus , but also by reassort between h9n2 and h5n1 virus . the first report evid of hybrid between h9n2 and h5n1 wa the case of human infect by highli patho- genic avian influenza ( hpai ) h5n1 viru in 1997 , and the qa/hk/g1/97 ( h9n2 ) -like virus were hypothes to have been involv in the gener of the h5n1 viru [ 15 ] . previous isol h9n2 influenza virus that reas- sort with h5n1 virus could also be found elsewher : those possess the h5n1-like pb1 gene segment were from southeastern china [ 14 ] , and h9n2 virus with NS gene origin from the hpai h5n1 lineag were iso- late from pakistan [ 16 ] . howev , the pathogen of these reassort wa not clear [ 14,16 ] . notic , in our studi , both the PA and NP gene of ck/sd/ly-1/08 ( gen- otyp 63 ) share high homolog ( 98 % -99 % ) with the h5n1 virus circul around the year 2005 , such as A/ chicken/china/1/02 ( h5n1 ) [ genbank : dq023146 ] , A/ swine/shandong/2/03 ( h5n1 ) [ genbank : ay646426 , ay700213 ] , and a/environment/qinghai/1/2008 ( h5n1 ) [ genbank : fj455823 , fj455825 ] . interestingli , one h5n1 reassort viru , a/plateau pika/qinghai/04/2007 ( h5n1 ) , wa close relat to ck/sd/ly-1/08 in it pb2 ( 98.4 % homolog ) [ genbank : fj390058 ] , PA ( 98.5 % homolog ) [ genbank : fj390060 ] , and NP ( 99.6 % homol- ogi ) [ genbank : fj390062 ] gene segment ( addit file 1 , figure.s1 , G and H ) . It also contain the ck/bei-lik M and NS gene , as well as a y439-like pb1 gene . It wa demonstr that multipl reassort have occur between h9n2 and h5n1 subtyp sinc the earli out- break , and they continu exchang intern gene seg- ment and gener novel virus . h9n2 virus of differ genotyp and reassort pattern could have huge differ in their pathogen and transmiss in mammal ( balb/c mice and swine ) under experiment condit [ 2,7,9 ] . In the present studi , the major of the recent circul genotyp b65 and b55 virus , which includ the pb2 gene segment from an unknown origin and/or the M gene segment from the g1- like lineag , display low infect abil in mice ( tabl 3 and figur 2 ) . In addit , ck/sd/ly-1/08 ( genotyp b63 ) wa abl to replic well in mice lung with high viru titer but caus mild clinic symptom ( tabl 3 and figur 3 surviv percentag of mice infect with h9n2 virus . group of mice ( n = 4 ) were inocul i.n . with each of eight h9n2 virus at a dose of 107 eid50 . the percent surviv wa observ daili for 14 day . Bi et al . virolog journal 2011 , 8:505 http : //www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/505 page 7 of 11 figur 2 ) . natur select suggest that a less virul strain is more like to co-exist with the host popul becaus mobil , live host will transmit the strain most effect [ 17 ] . thu , whether the chang in the host adapt and replic abil of ck/sd/ly-1/08 are associ with the h5n1 donor of the PA and NP gene segment must be explor further . importantli , two earli strain in our studi ( ck/hlj/u/98 in genotyp G2 and ck/ sd/wf/98 in genotyp B0 ) caus the death of infect mice without prior adapt ( figur 3 ) , though a previou studi of sever h9n2 virus belong to the same geno- type report non-leth in mice [ 2 ] . the similar discor- dant infect in mice with same genotyp virus wa also observ in thi studi , ck/sd/bd/10 , ck/sd/03/10 and ck/sd/02/09 were all in the genotyp b65 , and the former two virus nearli could n't replic in mice lung , but the third strain were abl to replic well in mice lung without prior adapt . It wa report that the mutat of e627k and d701n in pb2 gene were the key factor for a viru to acquir the abil to adapt to increas figur 4 repres histopatholog chang in hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) -stain respiratori system tissu ( nose , trachea , and lung ) . ck/sd/wf/98 virus-infect mice display sever bronchopneumonia and interstiti pneumonia in lung tissu ( A and D ) , which show interstiti edema and thicken of the alveolar wall , alveolar lumen flood with dropout of alveolar cell , erythrocyt , and inflammatori cell ( black squar ) , bronchial epitheli cell desquam ( thick solid arrow ) and extens lymphocyt , neutrophil , and plasma cell infiltr around the bronchiol and blood vessel ( thick white arrow ) ; congest in the blood vessel ( black triangl ) ; light ( B , H ) and intens ( E ) congest in the blood vessel of the nasal submucosa caus by the ck/sd/wf/98 and ck/sd/03/10 virus , respect ( black triangl ) ; congest in the blood vessel of the tracheal submucosa ( black triangl ) and dropout of the mucou epithelium in the trachea ( thick solid arrow ) caus by the ck/sd/wf/98 viru ( C and F ) . there were no obviou histopatholog chang in the respiratori system tissu of the ck/ sd/03/10-infect group and no signific differ compar to the pb mock-infect group .

In light of the persist evolut of h9n2 virus with high evolut rate , it is highli necessari to moni- tor the evolut and evalu the virul of novel avian h9n2 virus to mammal anim , which may dis- cover and prohibit the potenti threat to human by novel virus , and provid the key clue for prevent new pandem influenza . conclus here , we describ the genet and pathogen characteris- tic of the repres h9n2 virus isol from chicken farm in northern china over a 12-year span . phy- logenet analys reveal that h9n2 influenza virus evolv quickli in china , and new genotyp were fre- quentli gener in chicken flock . the present studi identifi two stabl h9n2 lineag ( genotyp b55 and b65 ) that have been circul in china in recent year . In addit , differ h9n2 virus possess divers replic capac and pathogen in mice . In summari , our studi provid evid to further understand the genet evolut and inter-speci trans- mission of h9n2 influenza A virus . their differ pathogenicitiy behavior and host adapt to mice may like be associ with both the gene reassort and key amino acid mutat . thu , surveil follow by large-scal sequenc effort and anim experi are critic import to detect the virul variant and pro- vide insight into the key featur for emerg of pan- demic virus . materi and method viru isol and identif surveil wa conduct in northern china from 1998 to 2010 . tracheal , cloacal and fecal swab , and lung tissu were collect from sick or dead chicken from chicken farm . the tissu homogen of clinic specimen were centrifug for 10 minut at 8 , 000 Ã— g , and after remov- ing bacteri contamin by micropor membran filter ( 0.22 m ) the supernat wa incub in the allanto caviti of 10-day-old specif pathogen free ( spf ) chicken egg ( beij merial vital laboratori anim technolog compani ) at 37â°c for 72 h for viral isol , final the allanto fluid wa harvest and store at -80â°c . the purif of all the strain wa done by the end-point dilut assay [ 19 ] , and subtyp wa perform as pre- viousli describ [ 20 ] . fifteen avian h9n2 virus were chosen for detail analysi ( addit file 3 , tabl S2 ) . viral gene sequenc viral rna wa extract from infect allanto fluid use trizol reagent ( invitrogen ) . revers transcript ( RT ) wa perform by use the uni12 primer ( agcaaaagcagg ) , and specif primer were design amplifi the eight full-length gene segment of the viru . the pcr product were purifi and sequenc from the beij genom institut use synthet oligonucleotid . genet and phylogenet analys To determin the molecular evolutionari characterist of h9n2 virus isol in china , eight gene segment from each of 15 isol were phylogenet analyz togeth with all the full length sequenc of the repres virus of china avail in genbank . the nucleotid and amino acid sequenc of each gene segment were analyz by dnaman ( version 5.2.2 , lynnon biosoft , usa ) and dnastar ( dnastar , inc. , madison , MI , usa ) soft- ware . the nucleotid sequence-bas phylogenet tree were gener with mega 4.1 http : //www.megasoftwar . net via neighbor-join algorithm and the reliabl of the tree wa assess by bootstrap analysi with 1 , 000 replic . genotyp analysi genotyp analysi wa perform systemat for each of the eight gene segment base on the distribut of lineag in phylogenet tree , and the gene share over 95 % homolog in the same lineag were consid as one genotyp group [ 1 ] . h9n2 virus accord to their HA lineag were divid into seven seri , design as a~g . virus with g1-like , ck/bei-lik , ck/korea/38349- p96323/96-like , y439-like , dk/hk/289/78-like , qa/hk/ af157/92-lik , ty/wi/1/66-lik HA gene were classifi into genotyp A , B , C , D , E , F , and G seri , respect [ 1 ] .
