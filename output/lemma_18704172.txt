No clinic sign were report for thi bird and it had a medium bodi mass respect to thi speci ( 630g [ 14 ] ) . It first remain for 17 day within an 8 km radiu of the captur site , perform daili movement of 1â­7 km ( figur 1 ) . It then flew eastward to chad in four stage ( 140â­175 km daili flight ) , cover a total distanc of 655 km . the satellit signal disappear a few day after thi duck had settl in the interior of lake chad , at 360 km from the sampl site . We consid a mortal associ with hpai infect unlik , sinc the time span between captur and signal disappear ( 47 day ) is long , and compar 6 time greater than the maximum time of death which ha been report in suscept wild waterfowl follow experiment infect with h5n1 hpai virus ( ,8 day post inocul ; [ 15â­18 ] ) . signal loss , though specula- tive , is like relat to the death of the bird ( either natur or by hunt ) or to the failur of the batteri of the transmitt . for comparison , anoth wfwd fit with a similar transmitt in nigeria , which test neg for type A influenza viru ( tabl 1 ) , stop transmit after 25 day . dure thi period , thi non- infect wfwd ( captur , sampl and equip at the same site on the same day ) had a similar movement pattern to the h5n2- infect wfwd , remain within the same hadejia-nguru wetland area ( within 17 km radiu of captur site dure the same first 18 day period ) , and perform similar short daili movement ( 1â­18 km ) . discuss the h5n2 virus we detect in two appar healthi wild waterfowl speci constitut a rare find of infect by aiv with an hpai viral genotyp in wild bird . until recent , aiv with an hpai viral genotyp had not been detect in free-liv wild bird [ 5,6 ] , except for a singl report of an h5n3 hpai viru outbreak in south africa [ 7 ] , and a few case in terrestri bird associ with outbreak in poultri [ 6,19 ] . sinc the emerg and spread of the asian h5n1 viru lineag over eurasia and africa , h5n1 hpai virus have been isol in a wide rang of wild bird speci . howev , both these h5n3 and h5n1 hpai virus were isol in sick , moribund or dead wild bird . despit extens global wildlif surveil effort , no infect with h5n1 hpai virus ha been detect in healthi wild bird , except for a few isol case [ 20,21 ] . therefor , the signific of wild bird as a sourc of infect and their influenc on the epidemiolog of h5n1 hpai virus is yet to be fulli establish . the two speci in which these h5n2 virus were detect are both anatida speci , a group of wild bird with a predomin role in the perpetu of lpai virus [ 2,22 ] . both speci forag in shallow water and are highli gregari outsid the breed season , two ecolog factor associ with an increas exposur to aiv infect . the fact that we detect these h5n2 virus at a three-day interv at the same site first suggest a viru transmiss between these two cohabit speci . wfwd and swg were the most abund afro-trop duck count at the sampl site ( 53 % and 40 % respect , n = 3772 ) . moreov , these two speci , which commonli share the same habitat at feed and roost site and have similar forag behaviour and daili activ pattern [ 14 ] , are prone to regular contact or to indirect aiv transmiss via share water . howev , high variat at the nucleotid and amino acid level wa observ between the nigerian h5n2 hpai sequenc detect in the wfwd and swg . the presenc of genet distinguish h5n2 hpai virus doe not support the hypothesi of a cluster of infect . rather , it indic the co-circul of distinct virus in the same waterfowl commun , suggest some degre of genet adapt to differ host speci . the surviv and movement of one of the h5n2 infect duck reveal by satellit telemetri provid evid of a non-leth natur infect by an aiv with an hpai viral genotyp in a wild duck . thi result is consist with the absenc of diseas sign or mortal gener report in duck for most hpai virus . befor the asian h5n1 hpai virus , no diseas or mortal event associ with a natur aiv infect had been report in either wild or domest duck ( [ 5 ] ;

We did not succeed in isol these virus , thu in vivo pathogen test to establish the pathogen for chicken [ 36 ] could not be perform . base on the clear fluoresc signal and the low Ct valu in real time pcr , the failur of the viru isol attempt wa probabl not relat to a sensit issu of the virolog method . rather , the reason for viru isol failur could be relat to the loss of viral viabil dure transport and storag or to a lack of adapt of the virus to the substrat use in the laboratori ( i.e. , spf embryon chicken egg ) [ 38 ] . caution should therefor be taken to consid the phenotyp of these nigerian virus as highli pathogen for chicken , sinc few except have been describ involv H5 virus with a multipl basic amino acid motif result in low pathogen in experiment infect chicken [ 37,39 ] . how- ever , the number of basic amino acid at the HA cleavag site of the nigerian h5n2 virus wa ident ( n = 7 ) to some other african h5n1 and h5n2 hpai virus ( tabl 2 ) . furthermor , the cleavag site of a/swg/nigeria/5388-2-8-5/2007 is ident to a/ostrich/south africa/n227/2004 ( h5n2 ) hpai which caus clinic sign characterist of hpai phenotyp [ 11 ] , suggest a potenti for an hpai behaviour of these virus . despit the rel proxim of our sampl site with past and recent h5n1 hpai viru outbreak in domest bird in northern nigeria ( # 80 km ) , the h5n2 virus we detect were unrel to ani 2004-07 h5n1 hpai strain from asia , europ or africa . the HA gene instead cluster with sequenc from duck from south and central europ , in particular with contemporari strain isol from wild duck , suggest a connect via migratori flyway . thi find is consist with the close relationship previous report between h5n1 hpai virus isol from nigerian poultri and european wild bird [ 40 ] and with the role suggest for the eurasian migratori bird in the occurr of H5 outbreak previous report in southern africa [ 41,42 ] . the two waterfowl speci we found infect in nigeria ( i.e . wfwd and swg ) are widespread across sub- saharan africa , but no african popul of either speci move out of the contin [ 14 ] . h5n2 virus were detect dure the mid-dri season of the sahel zone , when larg flock of afro- tropic duck speci congreg at perman water bodi in larg floodplain . At thi time of year , these bird also mix with a larg number of migratori duck origin from eurasian breed ground ( e.g . 50,000 garganey ana querquedula were present on the sampl site ) , which gather in tropic wetland dure the northern winter . thi suggest a potenti role of eurasian migratori duck in the introduct of these virus or their precursor into these ecosystem , which offer an interfac between eurasian and afro-trop wild duck . the propos mechan for the emerg of pathogen is that it occur onli after a viru ha been introduc and adapt to gallinac poultri popul [ 5 ] . thi theori is support by phylogenet analysi that demonstr share phylogenet sub- lineag among virus of both high and low pathogen [ 3,43 ] , and that identifi precursor of hpai virus of gallinac poultri in wild duck [ 44,45 ] . howev , the nigerian HA sequenc show littl or no homolog with recent h5n2 or h5n1 hpai virus isol from gallinac poultri in europ and africa . further , no mutat commonli observ in gallinac poultry-adapt AI virus were observ in their genom [ 12,13,43 ] , suggest that these virus may not have circul in gallinac poultri , at least not in an extens manner . thi appear to be support by the lack of evid of a circul in poultri of H5 virus differ from h5n1 hpai dure an extens activ surveil conduct over nigeria in 2007 ( T. joanni , person commun ) , or in sampl collect from suspect case in nigerian poultri in the same period h5n2 wa detect in wild waterfowl ( januaryâ­februari 2007 ) [ 46 ] . the absenc of molecular featur associ with an extens viral circul in gallinac bird , togeth with the absenc of evid of circul of H5 lpai precursor or hpai virus in gallinac bird in nigeria , suggest that the acquisit of an HP viral genotyp could have taken place in duck , either wild or domest , or in other non-gallinac speci . the site where the bird were sampl constitut one of the major wetland for waterbird in nigeria , but is also locat in one of the major area of free-rang duck product in thi countri [ 47 ] . wfwd and swg are found in all type of natur freshwat habitat , but they also commonli feed on rice field where domest duck may also feed . local condit are henc favour to potenti transmiss event between wild and domest duck , through direct contact or share water . though sever factor contribut to virul in aiv , the acquisit of multipl basic amino acid at the HA cleavag site is recognis as one of the major molecular determin in the develop of HP strain [ 37 ] . the presenc of coexist but genet distinguish avian influenza virus with an HP viral genotyp in two cohabit speci of wild waterfowl , with evid of non-leth infect at least in one speci and without evid of prior extens circul of the viru in domest poultri , suggest highli pathogen avian influenza in wild bird plo pathogen | www.plospathogens.org 7 august 2008 | volum 4 | issu 8 | e1000127 that some strain with a potenti high pathogen for poultri could be maintain in a commun of wild waterfowl . method wild bird surveil bird were captur use mist net with playback , bait trap and noos . both cloacal and oropharyng swab were collect from live-caught bird use steril cotton swab ( 5615 mm and 2610 mm size , dutscher manufactur ) . fresh faecal sampl were also collect at roost area ( non-captur bird ) , ensur that the exact speci yield the sampl were identifi . the health of bird wa assess by observ their movement prior to sampl , and for captur bird , by their behaviour in the hand , mass , and bodi condit . sampl were place in a transport medium consist of an isoton phosphat buffer salin ( pb ) , pH 7.0â­7.4 , contain antibiot and antimycot ( penicillin 10,000 units/ml , streptomycin 10 mg/ml , nystatin 1000 u/ml and gentamycin 250 mg/ml ) supplement with 20 % glycerol . sampl were store in liquid nitrogen directli in the field .
